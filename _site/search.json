    "text": "These are the procedures we follow on “Demo Day” — the last class of the course — during which students present their final projects to an audience of their peers and guests. Demo Day is public. All are welcome.\nThe only material you need for your presentation is a browser which can show both your project’s webpage and your Github repo. We don’t use Powerpoint or other nonsense.\nBasic idea is that all students are in two groups: A and B. A presents first. Each breakout room includes two students, an A and a B. (We will post the assignments.)\nAt the start, we are all in the main room. I offer introductions. I open the breakout rooms. You move yourself to your assigned room. (Guests will also go to the room featuring the student they want to listen to.) Chat politely. I will then issue a Breakout Room message saying to start. The A student presents her work for 4 minutes. The B student asks a lot of questions. So do the guests. These questions often involve your code. You can answer them by showing the actual R code in your Github repo.\nAfter three and a half minutes, I send a Message saying: 30 seconds left. At four minutes, I Message “Switch Rooms!”\nPlease switch rooms when I ask you to!\nStudent A stays in the room. Student B moves one room up. From room 6 to room 7, for example. (If you are the B student in the highest room, you move to room 1.) Then, Student A presents again.\nAfter 40 minutes of this, the A students will have presented 7 or 8 times. Good stuff! I bring back everyone to the main room. Say a few words. And then we do the whole thing again, but with the B students presenting and staying put in the rooms. And now the A students move from room to room.\nAfter the B students present, I close the breakout rooms, thereby bringing everyone back together. I offer thanks and congratulations. The course is now complete."

    "text": "This course is an excellent introduction to data science for students of any level, with a detailed textbook you can easily follow-along with! — Stephanie, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe data science course was an invaluable experience that provided me with the building blocks to pursue future data science investigations and analyses. The course was well-structured and taught me the fundamentals of not only producing stunning visualizations in R, but most importantly how to think like a data scientist and manage your code effectively. If you are someone interested in dipping their toes in an emerging field of data science, this course will guide you well! — Dhruv Syngol, Junior, Metea Valley High School\nThe learning environment was exceptional and encouraged me to navigate the basic challenges of RStudio with other students! It’s extremely effective for beginner individuals like me to gain this exposure! - Joyce Li, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe final project allowed me to draw from real world data about mental health disorders and learn how to make conclusions, moving me to be captivated by the data science field. —– Isaac Frank, Senior, Dublin Coffman High School\nThis course was really helpful! I learned a lot about data science and how to code in R. My favorite part were the breakout rooms since it allowed for students to share ideas and solve problems together. — Gabriel You (dengxuanjia@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe course tutorials were very informative and included an abundance of practice to ensure the material was understood. — Daniel Chen (danielc20051218@gmail.com), Junior, Naperville North High School\nThe course was an interesting way to learn the basics of data science, with the Final Projects being a great way to show what we grasped. — Oliver Raif Altindag (oliveraltindag@icloud.com), Freshman, Newton North High School\nGreat course overall. Introduces data science really well to people who may not have much knowledge about the field by showing important subjects such as data manipulation and visualization. Although some of the course content was slightly repetitive, it was still extremely effective in teaching students both basic and complex topics through the use of peer collaboration and the projects created at the end of the course. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to the language R and data science. — Abhay Paidipalli (abhay.paidipalli@gmail.com), Junior, James B. Conant High School\nBeing able to take part of a Harvard course, first of all, is such a valuable experience as you’re able to get a feel of the methodology that these elite institutions use. David Kane’s Data Science Boot camp was one of the most influential camps I’ve ever attended. Before this summer, I’ve never learned or touched a single piece of code and had no interest in programming, but after taking this course, it’s really made me fascinated in computer science, even going as far as planning to minor in cs. Working with Preceptor during the camp and under an apprenticeship really helped me gain valuable experience as well as sharpening skills in coding, critical thinking, and discipline. Also, it’s completely free. There’s so much to gain from this experience and nothing to lose. This camp is definitely one of the best offered to High school students and not one that you should pass on. — Bryan Li (libryan261@gmail.com/ 614-316-1061), Senior, Dublin Coffman High School\nThis course was valuable in helping me manage my time during school. Although I did not have any previous experience in R and Rstudio I had to learn to balance my school work and extracurriculars while meeting the demands of the course. — Joseph Jeiwan Kim (josephjwkim04@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks High School\nThis course does a fantastic job of not only putting you in the shoes of a student, learning the underlying coding and statistics, but also putting you in the shoes of a worker, doing real Data Science as a real Data Scientist. — George, senior, White Oaks Secondary School"
