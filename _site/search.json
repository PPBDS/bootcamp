    "text": "This course is an excellent introduction to data science for students of any level, with a detailed textbook you can easily follow-along with! — Stephanie, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe data science course was an invaluable experience that provided me with the building blocks to pursue future data science investigations and analyses. The course was well-structured and taught me the fundamentals of not only producing stunning visualizations in R, but most importantly how to think like a data scientist and manage your code effectively. If you are someone interested in dipping their toes in an emerging field of data science, this course will guide you well! — Dhruv Syngol, Junior, Metea Valley High School\nThe learning environment was exceptional and encouraged me to navigate the basic challenges of RStudio with other students! It’s extremely effective for beginner individuals like me to gain this exposure! - Joyce Li, Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe final project allowed me to draw from real world data about mental health disorders and learn how to make conclusions, moving me to be captivated by the data science field. —– Isaac Frank, Senior, Dublin Coffman High School\nThis course was really helpful! I learned a lot about data science and how to code in R. My favorite part were the breakout rooms since it allowed for students to share ideas and solve problems together. — Gabriel You (dengxuanjia@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks Secondary School\nThe course tutorials were very informative and included an abundance of practice to ensure the material was understood. — Daniel Chen (danielc20051218@gmail.com), Junior, Naperville North High School\nThe course was an interesting way to learn the basics of data science, with the Final Projects being a great way to show what we grasped. — Oliver Raif Altindag (oliveraltindag@icloud.com), Freshman, Newton North High School\nGreat course overall. Introduces data science really well to people who may not have much knowledge about the field by showing important subjects such as data manipulation and visualization. Although some of the course content was slightly repetitive, it was still extremely effective in teaching students both basic and complex topics through the use of peer collaboration and the projects created at the end of the course. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants an introduction to the language R and data science. — Abhay Paidipalli (abhay.paidipalli@gmail.com), Junior, James B. Conant High School\nBeing able to take part of a Harvard course, first of all, is such a valuable experience as you’re able to get a feel of the methodology that these elite institutions use. David Kane’s Data Science Boot camp was one of the most influential camps I’ve ever attended. Before this summer, I’ve never learned or touched a single piece of code and had no interest in programming, but after taking this course, it’s really made me fascinated in computer science, even going as far as planning to minor in cs. Working with Preceptor during the camp and under an apprenticeship really helped me gain valuable experience as well as sharpening skills in coding, critical thinking, and discipline. Also, it’s completely free. There’s so much to gain from this experience and nothing to lose. This camp is definitely one of the best offered to High school students and not one that you should pass on. — Bryan Li (libryan261@gmail.com/ 614-316-1061), Senior, Dublin Coffman High School\nThis course was valuable in helping me manage my time during school. Although I did not have any previous experience in R and Rstudio I had to learn to balance my school work and extracurriculars while meeting the demands of the course. — Joseph Jeiwan Kim (josephjwkim04@gmail.com), Senior, White Oaks High School\nThis course does a fantastic job of not only putting you in the shoes of a student, learning the underlying coding and statistics, but also putting you in the shoes of a worker, doing real Data Science as a real Data Scientist. — George, senior, White Oaks Secondary School"

Students in Group A present first. We will post the group assignments.\nAt the start, we are all in the main room. I offer introductions. I open the breakout rooms. Students go to their assigned rooms. (Guests will also go to the room featuring the student they want to listen to.) Chat politely. I will then issue a breakout room message saying to start. The A student presents her work for about 4 minutes. The B student asks a lot of questions. So do the guests.\nAfter three and a half minutes, I send a Message saying: 30 seconds left. At four minutes, I message “Switch Rooms!”\nPlease switch rooms when I ask you to!\nStudent A stays in the room. Student B moves one room up. From room 26 to room 27, for example. (If you are the B student in the highest room, you move to the lowest room number in your grouping which, in this case, might be something like room 22.) Then, Student A presents again.\nAfter 30 minutes of this, the A students will have presented 5 or 6 times. Good stuff! I bring back everyone to the main room. I say a few words. And then we do the whole thing again, with students again starting in the same rooms as in the first round, but, this time, with the B students presenting and staying put in the rooms. And now the A students move from room to room.\nAfter the B students present, I close the breakout rooms, thereby bringing everyone back together. I offer thanks and congratulations."

    "text": "Advice for Guests\nYou need three things: a Zoom link for Demo Day, the breakout room number in which your student is presenting, and whether she is in Group A (presenting first) or Group B (presenting second).\nBut please be flexible! We sometimes need a student to switch breakout rooms and/or switch from Group A to B. In Zoom, you should be able to see all the rooms (and who is in them) if you are having trouble finding your student.\nIf your student is in Group A, please try to arrive on time. If she is in Group B, you can arrive at the start and watch other presentations. Or, you can show up at the class midpoint so that you just watch her presentations.\nYou can also leave early, once you have seen your student present. (Many parents and grandparents like to watch their student present more than once. This is encouraged.) You are also welcome to check out other student presentations. Just move to any other breakout room whenever you like.\nMost importantly: ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!"

    "text": "Advice for Students\nThe only material you need for your presentation is a browser which can show both your project’s webpage and your Github repo. We don’t use Powerpoint or other nonsense.\nEnlarge the image of your project so that the font is large enough for your (older) viewers to read the title, legend and so on. Test how it looks beforehand.\nPlanning is important. Make sure that your TF knows your plans. For example, if a family event prevents you from attending Demo Day, let your TF know as soon as possible. Otherwise, you make her planning much more difficult.\nThe delicate dance of Demo Day depends on everyone doing their part. You need to show up on time. Otherwise, things get very confusing. If a last-minute emergency arises, email your TF, the head TF and Preceptor as soon as you know that you won’t be there.\nIn addition to presenting, you will also be attending presentations by several classmates. Be an engaged listener! Act toward them as you hope they will act toward you.\nMost importantly: ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS!\n\nWhen Presenting\nHave fun! Demo Day is a joyful occasion. Your (natural) nervousness is unwarranted. Everyone wants you to succeed. Share your screen the entire time. Always start on your project home page. Give your opening paragraph. Pause to see if anyone has any questions. If they don’t, spend another paragraph explaining the details of your main graphic. Pause again. Questions are fun, but you have to give people a chance to ask them.\nWhen pausing, use the “Take a sip of water” technique. Stop talking. Imagine that you are reaching for a class of water, lifting it up, taking a sip, and putting it back down. Only after that can you assume that there are no questions.\nSadly, you will sometimes be stuck with an audience too shy to ask questions. That is OK! One of the things you are learning in this class is how to handle different sorts of audiences. To handle a shy audience, you need to have prepared ahead of time 5 minutes worth of things to talk about. This can, and should, include a tour of your Github repository,\n\n\nWhen Listening\nAlways allow the student you are listening to to give their opening paragraph, perhaps even allowing them a second paragraph to explain their plot. But then interrupt them and ask a question. It doesn’t really matter what the question is. The important thing is to get a conversation going, to demonstrate to guests that questions are welcome and that they should ask some as well.\nCheck out the spreadsheet to see which student presentations you are likely to attend. Check out the webpages and Github repos ahead of time. Learn a little bit about the topics. The more you prepare, the better an audience you will be.\nNote that, in larger classes, we (conceptually) break up Demo Day into smaller collections which combine the students from two TFs together. This means that your TF (and her students) and another TF (and his students) are together, only using breakout rooms 22 to 28, for example. This means that, after you listen to the presentation in room 28, you don’t go to 29, you go back to room 22, the first room assigned to your collection."
