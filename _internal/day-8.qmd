Last class, we built a project. But it went fast! Students missed lots of things! Let's do it again, going quickly over some items while still spending time on important concepts. Key learning object is moving stuff from index.qmd to data-download and make-plots scripts as well as the use of saved objects.

We used the Hennepin County dot plot example from:

https://walker-data.com/census-r/mapping-census-data-with-r.html#dot-density-maps

Note that the data download code appears above this link.



## Scene 1: Make/Publish Website

Follow the same steps as in the Quarto Websites tutorial to build a new website from scratch.

* `File -> New Project... -> New Directory -> Quarto Website`

* Name the 'project-2`. `Create Project`. Make sure only git box is checked.

* `quarto publish` the project. Note the need to hit return twice. 

* Take a look at your cool website!

Send to rooms.

## Scene 2: Git/Github

Time to save our work in case our computer blows up.

* Edit the `.gitignore` to add `*Rproj`. Commit all files. Note how you can't push yet. No Github!

* Run: `usethis::use_github()`. 

* Push all files.

## Scene 3: Add Map

* Edit the `index.qmd`. Discuss why it is named "index." Copy the Hennepin dot density example:

https://walker-data.com/census-r/mapping-census-data-with-r.html#dot-density-maps

Note that you need to download the data in an earlier example. Need race and dots and tracts, then make the map.

Should work out of the box. Render. `quarto publish`. Now we are cooking with gas!

* Go to your rooms and choose a different state/county. What pops up? What aspects should you clean up, like messages and code echos?

## Scene 4: Separate out data download

* Don't want to download the data each time you render the home page. What a waste! Instead, move the data download to an R script and do it once. 

* Script must be self-containted. Must including libraries. Must save out the final tibble as an rds object.

* Edit the index.qmd to read in that rds file. No downloads every time.

## Scene 5: Separate out image creation

* Do the same thing with the plotting code which you did with the downloading data code. 

* `ggsave()` the plot.

* Change the `index.qmd` code so it just uses `knitr::include_graphics()` to bring in the graphic.

* Perhaps make data and images directories and place the two created files in them. Of course, you then need to change the path for any code which references those files.

## Scene 6: Clean Map

* Show how to clean up the appearance of the website with, for example, `echo: false` and `message: false`.

* Publish final version. Place link to website into #class-work.
