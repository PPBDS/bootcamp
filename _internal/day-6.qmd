## Goal

Use project which they were working with last class to create a plot using the NYC data.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)

x <- read_csv("data/nyc_tracts.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

x |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = race, y = med_income, color = med_income)) +
    geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.5) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    theme_minimal(base_size = 13) + 
    scale_color_viridis_c(guide = "none") + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar()) + 
    labs(x = "Largest group in Census tract", 
         y = "Median household income", 
         title = "Household income distribution by largest racial/ethnic group", 
         subtitle = "Census tracts, New York City", 
         caption = "Data source: 2016-2020 ACS")
```


## Session 7

Publish the plot to Rpubs. Looks OK. But it is a little ugly to have the title and, maybe the author, edit the YAML to remove. Re-publish. Add link to class-work.
