## Goal

Key question to answer this week: What is the relationship between the plurality race of NYC census tracts and their median incomes?

Core purpose of this week is to get comfortable using our tools to answer simple data science questions. We want students to be comfortable with R/RStudio/Git/Github/Quarto. 

For today, we are getting more comfortable with the Terminal and with file locations on our machines. Keep in mind that environment variables in Windows are surrounded with %. That is, $R_HOME on Mac is %R_HOME% on Windows. Also, backward slash on Windows (forward slash on Mac) for directory separators on the path.

By end of class, we should have the data downloaded. If we have time, we might start playing around with the data in Quarto. 

Next class processes the data and start the plotting.

Final class finishes the plot and publishes it.

## Session 1

Don't forget to do things in the class organization repo, not your personal one.

Start with a Github repo, named class-yyyy-mm-dd. Make sure it is public. Add a README. Connect it to RStudio.  

## Session 2

Cold call: Did everyone in your group succeed? Did you go on to start working on the data? Read the Preceptor's Notes!

Check out the Git window. Note the nagging. 

Edit the .gitignore but with *Rproj. Wild cards are handy! Note that the file name is red and has an asterisk, because we have not saved it. Show how nothing changes in the Git window until we save the file. Once we save it, the nagging about the Rproj ends, but we still need to commit .gitignore. Then we push.

Send to rooms to clean up. If you succeeded while I was demonstrating, that is OK! Now help your classmates.

Also, do the installs mentioned in #precepters-notes.

## Session 3

Cold call: Did everyone in your group succeed?

Go to: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.data/master/data-raw/nyc_tracts.csv 

Click on the download button to the right of the Raw button. Where is it now? Every computer is different! For most of you, there should be a Downloads folder in which nyc_tracts.csv has been placed.

ls ~/Downloads
ls ~/Download/nyc*

The second is useful if you have a lot of items in your Downloads folder.

Note that you need different commands on Windows. Or do you?


## Session 4

Cold call: Was everyone able to download the file and find where it was?

But where will we place the file? We might just stick it in the top-level of our project. That is fine for simple projects. But for anything more complex, we want organization, which generally means a "data" directory, although you can call it what you want.

pwd
ls
ls -a   
mkdir data
mv ~/Downloads/nyc_tracts.csv data/

Of course, you could do this by hand, with point-and-click and drag-and-drop. That is OK with one file. But not with 1,000!

Once it is there, note that we have some more nagging from the Git pane. We could update .gitignore. Or we might just check in the file. Data is trickier than text files. Discuss how we might include it in .gitignore if it were more than 100 mb. Large data sets are tricky! Add it to .gitignore. Maybe document where we got it from in the README.

Go to rooms and get the data into your projects. Help your friends.

## Session 5

Cold call: Was everyone able to move the file to the project?

Start a new Quarto document. Render it. Get rid of the junk. 

Tell them to add library(tidyverse).  Add in a label code option. Render. Note that you can render without saving since doing so causes an automatic save.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)
```

Back to rooms. Make sure everyone has done this. Start thinking about a plot. Did everyone do the necessary git steps? If your work isn't pushed, then you are not a professional.

What about the code in which we read in the data. Do that first!

## Session 6

Cold call: Walk me through the process of creating a new Quarto doc, with library(tidyverse).

If there is extra time, tell chatGPt about your data and ask it to suggest a cool looking plot. What does it come up with?
