## Class 1

Check the spreadsheet for your students and breakout room assignments. We will need to move things around as TFs come and go. For example, Ethan will take over Nosa's rooms at some point.

Identify a final project or two which you like and which you think are well done. It is OK if one of the projects is yours. Indeed, you should probably clean up your own final project just in case students want to look at it!

You should do more talking/directing today than you will do later. Indeed, you are talking almost all the time when you are in a room today. (This is totally different from later in the session, when you might say very little, allowing students to run the breakout rooms themselves.) Tell a different student to share their screen each time. Tell another student to do the "driving," to tell the first student what to click on. 

Make sure your display name in Zoom includes the name by which you want students to address you. Encourage students to do the same. 

Make sure your display name in Discord is the name by which students know you, could be just your first name or your whole name. Should not be something opaque. Encourage studnets to do the same. 


## Class 2




## Monday Class before Demo Day

Goal is to help students have a succesful final project. We do this by both helping them directly but also be highlighting cool stuff in other students' projects. After all, if student A is making interesting use of animation, there is still time for student B to add animation to his final project. 

The culture of data science is one that encourages inspiration from other data scientists!

Make sure to point out errors in following the Style Guide. Tell students to read it!

Tell students to write comments. In fact, spend 10 minutes during your breakout room having all students add comments. And then walk through those comments, giving feedback.

Discuss students' 4 sentence summaries. Focus on the takeaway point. What is the one sentence which they hope viewers will take away from their project?

Review the submissions to the spreadsheet. Several are not following the instructions. Ensure that they do. 

## Demo Day

Make sure that you travel in reverse room numerical order. (I prefer that you move in the opposite order to the students so that you are with different students each time.) That is, if you start in room 3, then you move to room 2 next, and so on.

It is your job to ensure that each presentation is interactive. It is boring for everyone involved if the presenting students just talks and talks. No one is listening! And they know it! Instead, it is up to you to ensure that everyone (and you) ask lots of questions. The presenter should never talk for more than 30 seconds straight.

## Advice for Teaching Fellows

First, two TFs are paired together and given a continuous set of breakout rooms, say 21 to 28. The two TFs should, obviously, coordinate ahead of time. They need one room for every two students so, in this case, with 8 rooms, they can't have more than 16 students between them. 

Second, the two TFs divide the students into two equal groups: A and B. If possible, all the students for one TF are in A and all the students for the other TF are in B. But, if the TFs are responsible for different numbers of students, this might not be possible. However, we try to keep students from the same TF together in the same Group as much as possible.

The key is that these two TFs and their students form a self-contained Demo Day ecosystem. They don't care what is going on in other breakout rooms. Other breakout rooms don't care about what is happening with them. This ensures that Demo Day can continue even if some groups get messed up.

At this point, all students, regardless of TF, have been assigned to either A or B. Each breakout room has two "starting" students, an A and a B. Group A presents first.  

If a TF pairing features an odd number of students, then one of the TFs pretends to be a student so that there is always someone listening to a student's presentation. Annoyingly, this often occurs at the last minute when a student fails to show. So, at the start, TFs need to pay attention and be nimble.

If there are an odd number of students, it is best if the extra student is placed in Group A and in the last room in your suite of rooms. That is, you have an extra presenter in the first round. Again, you might need to do this at the after Demo Day has started and you notice that a student is missing. In that case, you will often have to tell a student that she is now in Group A instead of Group B and should present first. One of the TFs then replaces the missing student by being a fake Group B "student" who just moves from room to room, listening to presentations in the first round. In the second round, this TF does not need to pretend any longer. She does not present, obviously. Instead, the room that she was in is eliminated from the cycle. (Obviously, it is helpful if this is the highest room in the group.)

The Group A student who was in that room is now moved one room up, to a different starting room. Of course, that room already has a Group A student in it. And that is OK! There is nothing wrong with having two Group A students moving from room-to-room, listening to a different Group B student each time. The key point is that a breakout room which was used in the first session is no longer in use. You need to ensure that Group A students know to skip that room.

If Group A and Group B are balanced or, in the case of imbalance, we are in the second session, then you are free to move around. See as many presentations as you can, even if you can't stay for any individual presentation from start to finish. Students won't mind if you arrive late or leave early. They know that you have a lot of rooms to worry about. But they always appreciate it if you can see at least some of their presentation.

Whenever you visit a room, make sure that questions are being asked. The best way to do that is to ask a question yourself! You can also interrupt and tell the audience student to ask a question. Anything which gets the conversation going is a good idea.

Even when you are visiting rooms, you (and/or your partner) need to keep an eye on all your other rooms, especially when we transition. Too often, a student will delay moving from room N to N+1. The reason for this delay is generally innocuous. They are just honestly intererested in the presentation! They have more questions!

Doesn't matter! Delays are bad. First, they prevent the student in the current room from starting their next presentation. After all, a new student has just entered the room. Making her wait is rude. Even worse, the presenting student in room N+1 is sitting their alone, waiting. She doesn't know what is happening. Why has no one come to her room? Delay is unfair to her as well.
