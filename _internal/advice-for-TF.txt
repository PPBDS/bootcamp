# TF Advice

Someone is always sharing their screen. Someone is always telling that screen sharer what to type. There is always one sharer and one driver. And those roles switch often, at least every time we go back to breakout rooms from the main room. Your most important job is to make that happen, and make sure that all students participate.

Motto: Always tell. Never ask.

That is, do not ask "Who wants to share their screen?" Instead, say "Joe, please share your screen." This class is serious and we have no time for dawdling. You are in charge. This helps to ensure that everyone shares their screen, and drives, the same amount.

Start by telling someone to share their screen. If they are messed up somehow, switch to a different person. Tell another person to drive. If they are clueless, no worries! Just say, "No worries. John (new person), please direct Sarah." If John is clueless, switch immediately to a new person. After a few minutes, have a different person share their screen. Choose a different driver. Never share your screen. Never, or at least rarely, drive. Never waste time with people who are having weird difficulties. Fix weird difficulties after class is over.

Keep the Head TF informed. They will create a spreadsheet in which you can indicate what days, if any, you are missing. Most important day to not miss is the last Demo Day. Try to be there, if you can. But, always remember: Family comes first!

When we are doing a data science project, emphasize how there are often a variety of plausible approaches. Reasonable people will often, for example differ in the rows of the Preceptor Table or in the variables they include in the model. We see that in how different breakout rooms make different choices. But it is easiest if every student in a single breakout room makes the same choices for that day's class. So, you should guide each of your breakout rooms to do so. In fact, it is best to guide all rooms toward the path in our answer. If they get too far off-track, it may be tough to bring them back. 



### Week 1

We place all your students, even if there are a 12+ of them, in a single breakout room during week 1. This is OK. You need to guide them all the time, so you can't switch from room-to-room. Also, more than a few students will fail to have a clue and/or have major computer problems. (Never try to solve a student's computer problems during class. There isn't enough time and you will lose the rest of the room.) With everyone is the same room, you can run the show, changing sharers and drivers each time, always having plenty of options if a sharer or driver isn't working.

After week 1, we should have lost most of the students we are going to lose. You will also have a much better sense of your students strengths and weaknesses. 

On Thursday of Week 1:

* Make sure your display name in Zoom includes the name by which you want students to address you. Force students to do the same. 

* Make sure your display name in Discord is the name by which students know you, could be just your first name or your whole name. Should not be something opaque. Force students to do the same. 


### Week 2

You work with the head TF to have smaller breakout rooms for week 2. These might still be bigger than the ideal number of 3 or 4. In general, the head TF will just let you decide. Take your 12 students and split them into three breakout rooms as you see fit. But make sure that you have done so by Sunday night before week 2 starts. Advice:

* Keep friends together.

* Keep sensible groups together. If you have a bunch of 8th graders, it is generally better to keep them together.

* No worries if all breakout rooms are not the same size. Indeed, it is often useful, if you have two strong, committed friends, to just give them a breakout room of two, assuming that they are both committed to showing up to almost every class.

### Week 3

## Class 1

Identify a final project or two which you like and which you think are well done. It is OK if one of the projects is yours. Indeed, you should probably clean up your own final project just in case students want to look at it!

You should do more talking/directing today than you will do later. Indeed, you are talking almost all the time when you are in a room today. (This is totally different from later in the session, when you might say very little, allowing students to run the breakout rooms themselves.) Tell a different student to share their screen each time. Tell another student to do the "driving," to tell the first student what to click on. 

## Class 2


## For the Cardinal Virtues

1) The students (and you) should spend lots of time with our summary of the Cardinal Virtues: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html. Students generally won't read the Primer. But do everything you can to get them to read that chapter.

2) Never just tell them the answer. Force them to work on it. To talk it out amongst themselves. Point them to the relevant portion of the Cardinal Virtues chapter. Are they having trouble with the Preceptor Table? Open up the chapter, go to that portion, point out the sub-steps which guide us in making the table. Are they having trouble writing the paragraph after Justice? Open the chapter, go to that portion, and point out the example there. 

3) Talk as little as you can. Students learn by doing, not by listening. Of course, you need to talk some, as discussed here. But instead of saying X, call on a student and get her to say X.

4) Force students to write stuff down, the more detailed the better. If I ask for a written description of the Preceptor Table for this problem, you want everyone in the group to write down a description. (It is OK if their descriptions differ.) To ensure this, we follow our usual procedure of someone sharing their screen and then just typing what the "driver" tells him to type. Others in the group are typing as well. Switch the screen "sharer" often. It is your job to ensure that everyone is typing. This does not require much talking. As long as you force all students to share their screens, they will type.

5) For many questions, there is no right answer. It is OK if different breakout rooms have different answers, OK if different students in the same breakout room have different answers. But you should emphasize consistency. That is, the specific question should be consistent with the Preceptor Table which should be consistent with the Population Table and with all the assumptions.



## Monday Class before Demo Day

## During Demo Day

Make sure that you travel in reverse room numerical order. (I prefer that you move in the opposite order to the students so that you are with different students each time.) That is, if you start in room 3, then you move to room 2 next, and so on.

It is your job to ensure that each presentation is interactive. It is boring for everyone involved if the presenting students just talks and talks. No one is listening! And they know it! Instead, it is up to you to ensure that everyone (and you) ask lots of questions. The presenter should never talk for more than 30 seconds straight.

First, two TFs are paired together and given a continuous set of breakout rooms, say 21 to 28. The two TFs should, obviously, coordinate ahead of time. They need one room for every two students so, in this case, with 8 rooms, they can't have more than 16 students between them. 

Second, the two TFs divide the students into two equal groups: A and B. If possible, all the students for one TF are in A and all the students for the other TF are in B. But, if the TFs are responsible for different numbers of students, this might not be possible. However, we try to keep students from the same TF together in the same Group as much as possible.

The key is that these two TFs and their students form a self-contained Demo Day ecosystem. They don't care what is going on in other breakout rooms. Other breakout rooms don't care about what is happening with them. This ensures that Demo Day can continue even if some groups get messed up.

At this point, all students, regardless of TF, have been assigned to either A or B. Each breakout room has two "starting" students, an A and a B. Group A presents first.  

If a TF pairing features an odd number of students, then one of the TFs pretends to be a student so that there is always someone listening to a student's presentation. Annoyingly, this often occurs at the last minute when a student fails to show. So, at the start, TFs need to pay attention and be nimble.

If there are an odd number of students, it is best if the extra student is placed in Group A and in the last room in your suite of rooms. That is, you have an extra presenter in the first round. Again, you might need to do this at the after Demo Day has started and you notice that a student is missing. In that case, you will often have to tell a student that she is now in Group A instead of Group B and should present first. One of the TFs then replaces the missing student by being a fake Group B "student" who just moves from room to room, listening to presentations in the first round. In the second round, this TF does not need to pretend any longer. She does not present, obviously. Instead, the room that she was in is eliminated from the cycle. (Obviously, it is helpful if this is the highest room in the group.)

The Group A student who was in that room is now moved one room up, to a different starting room. Of course, that room already has a Group A student in it. And that is OK! There is nothing wrong with having two Group A students moving from room-to-room, listening to a different Group B student each time. The key point is that a breakout room which was used in the first session is no longer in use. You need to ensure that Group A students know to skip that room.

If Group A and Group B are balanced or, in the case of imbalance, we are in the second session, then you are free to move around. See as many presentations as you can, even if you can't stay for any individual presentation from start to finish. Students won't mind if you arrive late or leave early. They know that you have a lot of rooms to worry about. But they always appreciate it if you can see at least some of their presentation.

Whenever you visit a room, make sure that questions are being asked. The best way to do that is to ask a question yourself! You can also interrupt and tell the audience student to ask a question. Anything which gets the conversation going is a good idea.

Even when you are visiting rooms, you (and/or your partner) need to keep an eye on all your other rooms, especially when we transition. Too often, a student will delay moving from room N to N+1. The reason for this delay is generally innocuous. They are just honestly intererested in the presentation! They have more questions!

Doesn't matter! Delays are bad. First, they prevent the student in the current room from starting their next presentation. After all, a new student has just entered the room. Making her wait is rude. Even worse, the presenting student in room N+1 is sitting their alone, waiting. She doesn't know what is happening. Why has no one come to her room? Delay is unfair to her as well.

Pay especially close attention to the highest number breakout room. Too often, the listening student in this room isn't paying attention and, instead of moving to the lowest room number at the next switch, he just moves up again, either into an unused room or, even worse, into a room associated with a different TF pair. If this happens, you need to visit that room, interrupt things immediately, and tell your student where he should go.

Of course, even better is to prevent this from happening by monitoring the highest room closely. Indeed, this can be a good room to go to toward the end of a presentation, if only to remind the listening student to move to start, instead of to room N+1.

## Giving Advice for on Student Projects

* Unlike in most classes, you are the one screen sharing most of the day. Note my example at the start of the class.

* The most important thing is to give clear, specific feedback. This might feel "mean," but pulling your punches only hurts students. They need the truth from you. Give it to them.

* Review the Project tutorial, especially the list at the beginning of all the specific things which their projects should contain. Just go through that list point-by-point, giving credit for each point which the student takes care of correctly, but also pointing out each place in which they fail to follow the instructions.

* Once you check that they have a link to their GitHub repo on their About page, click on it, go to the repo, and offer some feedback. Recall what the Style Guide says about commenting: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html#comments

* Involve other students by calling on them by name. For example, click on the About page for George's project and say, "Sarah: What items should we see on George's about page?" Of course, correct her if she misses any that should be there.

* Depending on time, you might have the chance to do a replication. Ask for a volunteer and/or ask a strong students if you can replicate her work. Then, have a different student share their screen, but you do the driving. (Students are no experienced enough to drive a replication themselves, especially if things start breaking.) Fork, connect R project, and see if `quarto preview` works. Very fun when it doesn't!
