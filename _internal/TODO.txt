## Priorities

### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the Visualization chapter to use the data.

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.




## Other


* We want the sign-up-for-the-email to be more prominent. We have the raw html which, I think, we need to include. It is in sign_up.html. But when I follow the instructions here:

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/include-html.html

It does not work. There is space for an image/thing, but the rectangle is empty.

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
