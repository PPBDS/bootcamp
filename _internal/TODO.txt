## Priorities for June Class

Decide on timing. Could start Monday May 27th, which is after AP exams but is Memorial Day. If so, we could get 5 weeks in before July 1 departure for Europe. Then, pause for two weeks. Then three weeks from July 15 through August 1. That seems sensible!

ask our one user for a retweet.

Update schedule to accomodate 8 weeks/

Maybe we require the tutorial.helpers tutorial to even register for the course?

Think about using Posit Cloud.

## Projects for Apprentices



### Tutorials for Tidymodels with R

I think we need to do the entire book. But note that there really isn't that much code . . .


### tutorial.helpers

Matthew Ru

Maybe another student? See TODO.txt file for some of the many issues.

One student in charge of figuring out how to process these for a class of 50. Is the gmail approach best? Does it still work? Need an option of working with a zip folder of submissions, like what we might get from Canvas or Moodle.

Process answers as html files rather than rds, I think.

### Primer Chapters

For 4, 5, and 6, just improve the associated tutorials.

For 7 through 11, write the overview tutorials and make the chapters better, especially with the use of the Four Cardinal Virtues.

### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the Visualization chapter to use the data.

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.




## Other



* Think about changing Day 1 to use Posit Cloud. FYI: tutorials (of all sorts) do not work if you install remotes and then the package. However, if you:

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

After restarting, the initial attempt to run a tutorial will fail. The tutorial will build, but you will get a "Connection refused"" message. Just hit the Home button and try the tutorial a second time.

Or maybe this works now! Or maybe you need to build it once, then restart and try it again. Annoying!


* The Preceptor Notes in the first week are too long. Move some of that material, like R Weekly, to week 2.

* Figure out way to create an email list for just the class itself, will change for each session of the class. Maybe temporary substacks? 

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
