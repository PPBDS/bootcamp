## Things to do when class is Over

Change the id's in r4ds.tutorials so that they match the folder names, like 00-introduction because it is best if how you call the tutorial matches the default file name.


## Priorities for June Class

Consider this as an example: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/05/us/politics/congress-age.html

First project is an AI project!

Outline class schedule for future summers. Example: All positron and related tutorials are done by week 2 so that students can start building websites in week 3, in preparation for Demo Day in week 4. All Primer tutorials are done by week 6, so week 7 can be spent building models, in preparation for Demo Day in week 8. Main homework for week 3 is lots of introductions to all sorts of data sources. Want to give students plenty of suggestions so that they can find something they like.

Weeks 1/2: Positron and related tools.
Week 3: Data sources, like tidycensus.
Week 4: Demo Day
Weeks 5/6: Finish Primer tutorials
Week 7: Lots of example models to build
Week 8: Demo Day


* I hope to have hundreds of students next summer. I need to work on tools now for managing that. See PraireLearn, Moodle, Google sheets and so on. 

  + 1) Where should students upload files? We currently use Google forms which puts stuff in a Google drive folder. This works pretty well! But I need to download the resulting folder by hand, which is no good. Surely, we can automate this. But can we automate it for all TFs. (We want TFs to be able to see and analyze the homeworks submitted by their students.) A second option would be DropBox. Others?
  
  + 2) Where do we keep track of the students in the class and key information associated with them? That information would be name, email, TF, breakout room, presentation room. Maybe only me and the head TFs need to edit it. I think that this might just be a Google sheet. We would want all staff to be able to access it since doing so would provide the info to allow scripts to just return a given TF's students' work.
  
  + 3) Where do we populate information about work completed? That is, we want to be able to report who has submitted each homework, perhaps also with the number of answers. We need to put that information somewhere, update it with scripts, and then allow TFs to be able to access it. 

Who is in charge of data suggestions?

Get Data Project and Model Project tutorials ready. Or maybe there is just one tutorial, and you can skip the model questions if they are not relevant.

Add tutorial running instructions in each README for tutorial packages.

### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.


## Other

* The Preceptor Notes in the first week are too long. Move some of that material, like R Weekly, to week 2.

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?

## Marketing

Rweekly.
