## Priorities for June Class

First project is an AI project!

Outline class schedule for future summers. Example: All positron and related tutorials are done by week 2 so that students can start building websites in week 3, in preparation for Demo Day in week 4. All Primer tutorials are done by week 6, so week 7 can be spent building models, in preparation for Demo Day in week 8. Main homework for week 3 is lots of introductions to all sorts of data sources. Want to give students plenty of suggestions so that they can find something they like.

Weeks 1/2: Positron and related tools.
Week 3: Data sources, like tidycensus.
Week 4: Demo Day
Weeks 5/6: Finish Primer tutorials
Week 7: Lots of example models to build
Week 8: Demo Day

Who is in charge of data suggestions?

Get Data Project and Model Project tutorials ready. Or maybe there is just one tutorial, and you can skip the model questions if they are not relevant.

Add tutorial running instructions in each README for tutorial packages.

### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.


## Other

* The Preceptor Notes in the first week are too long. Move some of that material, like R Weekly, to week 2.

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?

## Marketing

Rweekly.
