### Consider this college data:

Baseline Cross-Sectional Estimates of Child and Parent Income Distributions by College


### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the Visualization chapter to use the data.

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.




## Other

* Consider redoing the first week so that we don't race to get something posted to Rpubs on Day 2. Instead, aim to have a nice graphic posted on Day 3. As part of this change, we might spend all of Day 2 working in an R script. That would make things much easier, and would allow us to nail down the distinction between a text file and the Console. We would also get good at command-return as well as sourcing a whole file, much as is done in the RStudio and Code tutorial. We would still start with a new R project on Day 2, but nothing from Quarto until Day 3. The script from Day 2 might not be perfect, but it would have a plot with the key components. We would provide the script as a starting point for Day 3. Might make a promise on Day 1 that we will publish to the web a plot like this (and show the example) by the end of the week. 

* Think about changing Day 1 to use Posit Cloud. FYI: tutorials (of all sorts) do not work if you install remotes and then the package. However, if you:

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

After restarting, the initial attempt to run a tutorial will fail. The tutorial will build, but you will get a "Connection refused"" message. Just hit the Home button and try the tutorial a second time.

Or maybe this works now! Or maybe you need to build it once, then restart and try it again. Annoying!


* The Preceptor Notes in the first week are too long. Move some of that material, like R Weekly, to week 2.

* Figure out way to create an email list for just the class itsel, will change for each session of the class. Maybe temporary substacks? 


* We want the sign-up-for-the-email to be more prominent. We have the raw html which, I think, we need to include. It is in sign_up.html. But when I follow the instructions here:

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/include-html.html

It does not work. There is space for an image/thing, but the rectangle is empty.

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
