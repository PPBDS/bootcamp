## Priorities for June Class

Update schedule.

Bite the bullet and remove chapters 1, 2, 3. Could add some if it to the Getting Started chapter, and then maybe create a Chapter 1 tutorial to go along with it, either in R4DS or in all.primer.tutorials.

Start work on tutorials for chapters 4 through 8. Looks like students will be doing them. And we certainly don't want to create any problem sets!

Think about using Posit Cloud.


Create as many r4ds tutorials as possible.

Maybe we want an iteration tutorial, given the code we use in chapter 5?

Create tidycensus.tutorials package. Move over material from all.primer.tutorials.

Create teaching.tutorials. These are tutorials for my specific assignments. Might only include final_projects tutorial, but could have other stuff. Maybe add data: api tutorial? Maybe add quarto websites tutorial?

* Clean out chapters 1 through 3 in Primer. Maybe delete them completely? Update Getting Started to explain, perhaps? 


## Projects for Apprentices

### Bootcamp Tutorials

* Good for students starting soon.

* Writing ones we need. Start with strings and regular expressions.

* Taking ownership of ones that are done and using student feedback to make them better.

### Other R4DS tutorials

* Chapters 26 (functions), 27 (iterations), 28 (base R).

* 26/27 each make good month-long projects, both because they are hard and because we should do much more than what is covered in the book.

### R4DS infrastructure

Do what is necessary to get this on CRAN. Start by shrinking the size.

### Tutorials for R Packages 2e

tutorial for Chapter 2 (the whole game) . Want to ensure that all students have made an R package. Maybe this goes in teaching.tutorials. Maybe rename it making.tutorials? creation.tutorials?

tutorial for chapters 14 and 15 from R packages 2e. Students need to learn how to make a test. Maybe this and chapter 2 go together?

tutorial for function documentation and vignettes? More that I look at this, more it seems that we need and r.packages.tutorials package.


### Tutorials for Tidymodels with R

I think we need to do the entire book. But note that there really isn't that much code . . .


### tutorial.helpers

Matthew Ru

Maybe another student? See TODO.txt file for some of the many issues.

One student in charge of figuring out how to process these for a class of 50. Is the gmail approach best? Does it still work? Need an option of working with a zip folder of submissions, like what we might get from Canvas or Moodle.

Process answers as html files rather than rds, I think.

### Primer Chapters

For 4, 5, and 6, just improve the associated tutorials.

For 7 through 11, write the overview tutorials and make the chapters better, especially with the use of the Four Cardinal Virtues.


### tidycensus.tutorials

* Move over the current tutorials from all.primer.tutorials.

* Split them up into individual chapters.

* Add other chapters.



## Other Topics

### Consider this college data:

Baseline Cross-Sectional Estimates of Child and Parent Income Distributions by College


### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the Visualization chapter to use the data.

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.




## Other


* Consider redoing the first week so that we don't race to get something posted to Rpubs on Day 2. Instead, aim to have a nice graphic posted on Day 3.  We would still start with a new R project on Day 2, but nothing from Quarto until Day 3.  Might make a promise on Day 1 that we will publish to the web a plot like this (and show the example) by the end of the week. 

* Think about changing Day 1 to use Posit Cloud. FYI: tutorials (of all sorts) do not work if you install remotes and then the package. However, if you:

install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

After restarting, the initial attempt to run a tutorial will fail. The tutorial will build, but you will get a "Connection refused"" message. Just hit the Home button and try the tutorial a second time.

Or maybe this works now! Or maybe you need to build it once, then restart and try it again. Annoying!


* The Preceptor Notes in the first week are too long. Move some of that material, like R Weekly, to week 2.

* Figure out way to create an email list for just the class itsel, will change for each session of the class. Maybe temporary substacks? 


* We want the sign-up-for-the-email to be more prominent. We have the raw html which, I think, we need to include. It is in sign_up.html. But when I follow the instructions here:

https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/include-html.html

It does not work. There is space for an image/thing, but the rectangle is empty.

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
