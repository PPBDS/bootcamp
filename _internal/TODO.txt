### Center the course around the social capital data and New York Times article.

* Add the relevant data for replicating the plots in the Times article to the primer.data package.

* Change Day 1 lecture to highlight the article, and show the Quarto website which replicates the key results, and even expands on them.

* Change Day 2 and Day 3 lectures to use the data from there. 

* Change the Visualization chapter to use the data.

* Change the initial tutorials to use the data.




## Other

* The Preceptor Notes in the first week are too long. Move some of that material, like R Weekly, to week 2.

* Figure out way to create an email list for just the class itself, will change for each session of the class. Maybe temporary substacks? 

Is whimsical a useful tool for teaching the class itself?
