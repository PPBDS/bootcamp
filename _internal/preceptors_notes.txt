# This is a collection of Preceptor's Notes for use before class. 
# This is a text document because the contents need to be copy/pasted into Discord.

## Next Time

Make more use of #projects channel as a location for students to prove that they have made progress on the projects, and do it earlier in the course.

Reigstration ends two weeks before. 00-introduction is due Sunday night (then you get Discord link and head TF email). 01-code is due Wednesday before the start.

Only 3 tutorials due Wednesday.


## Outline

See the big_picture.txt file.

End of week 1, Github/Rpubs using library data
End of week 2, Github/Rpubs using downloaded data
End of week 3, Github/Quarto Website. Three different practice websites, each time using a potential data type: census, tidytext, and . . .


## Standard Preparations

* Reach out to potential TFs. Check to see if any are interested in younger or older breakout rooms. Confirm that they are all available on Demo Days.

* Make sure all TFs appear on the staff page, with their emails.

* Set up new Github organization under your personal account. Use this for class repos. Follow bootcamp-2023-01 as a naming convention https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024

* Create a new location for example reprexes at Posit Community for the Getting Help tutorial. Here is the most recent one: https://forum.posit.co/t/thread-for-students-posting-practice-reprexes-please-do-not-answer-them/187087

* Update link in Getting Help tutorial with this new location.

* Update link in Data Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet students fill out.

* Update link in Final Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet.

* Update link in Terminal tutorial (and Primer) for rtools.

* Set up empty project for first class so your set up looks like student set up.

* Be careful about forks. If you have students fork from repo class-2022-08-01, you can not then change the name of this tutorial to class-2022-08-02 and then have them fork from it again. The reason is that these are the same repo, but with a name change, and you can't fork twice from the same repo.

# First TF Meeting

Confirm that everyone can see #staff channel and that their Discord display name is sensible.

```
\nick name-you-want
```

Confirm that everyone has a sensible Zoom display name.

Confirm that everyone can attend Demo Days.


Anyone interested in Older breakout room? Younger room?

We will be making extensive use of AI. I recommend the free version of ChatGPT. Unless you feel strongly, use this so students can do the same. But, if you are using a paid version of this, or another AI, that is fine to. 

Thanks to Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) for volunteering to be Head TF. 

Show breakout room spreadsheet, including TF schedule sheet. Fill out attendance spreadsheet as best as possible. You can change it later.



Code for creating the class list:

set.seed(9)
x |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(! information_name %in% c("Luit Deka", "Aditya Chaudhary", "Alan Cai", "Monish Malla", "Atharva Bir Dutta")) |> 
  slice_sample(prop = 1) |> 
  select(information_name, information_email) |>  
  distinct(information_email, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
  write_csv("~/Downloads/class.csv") -> y
  

## Week 1

### Email with Zoom Link for First Class

This email is going out to all the students who have completed the first homework assignment. Please read it closely and follow all the instructions.

0) Call me "Preceptor," not "David" nor "Mr. Kane" nor "Bro."

1) Class today at 8:00 PM EST at 



Be early, not late. I will often shut the room at 8:01 and not allow anyone to attend late. Make sure that you have updated your Zoom client ahead of time.

2) Login in to our Discord server at:


We distribute class material on Discord, so you must use it.

3) If you are 15 or younger (or 30 or older), please email Head TF Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) with your name/email and age. We are organizing the groups by age, at least at the extremes. Even better is to DM Tejas this information on Discord itself.

4) To attend class on Wednesday, you must complete the homework for Wednesday by midnight on Tuesday. Feel free to start now.

I look forward to meeting you tonight!

Preceptor

# Part I

The goal for the first part of the course is to get good enough at R/RStudio/Git/Github that you can create an high quality data project with an associated webpage. The key materials are R4DS and r4ds.tutorials.

## Week 1

### Day 1

Link for breakout rooms: https://tinyurl.com/4py8abtu 

(Find the room which you have been assigned to. If you are not listed, stay in the main room with me.)

Call me "Preceptor."

No eight week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

Video on --- unless there is something going on in your life which prevents it. In which case, discuss with your TF.

Class always begins by looking at the Preceptor's Notes for the day, available here, in Discord.

1) After today, we start on time, often by going to breakout rooms immediately. Let's go now! Introduce yourself to your fellow students with one sentence.  

2) Link to consider today (was distributed earlier at #general)

https://tinyurl.com/muafxp9u

Over the last four decades, the financial circumstances into which children have been born have increasingly determined where they have ended up as adults. But an expansive new study, based on billions of social media connections, has uncovered a powerful exception to that pattern that helps explain why certain places offer a path out of poverty.

For poor children, living in an area where people have more friendships that cut across class lines significantly increases how much they earn in adulthood, the new research found.

3) Update these packages now from the R Console.

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/positron.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")
```

This should be the last time you need to mess with these packages.

4) Submit the assignments or you will be removed from the class. Central metaphor of the class is Ulysses and the Sirens. There are several tutorials due on Tuesday at midnight. Skip any questions which gives you trouble. Don't forget to answer the questions about your name, email and the number of minutes it took to complete the tutorial. 

Use the default name for your HTML submissions, e.g., `02-quarto_answers.html`

5) Sign up for free version of chatGPT (https://chatgpt.com/) as well as other services.

6) Thanks to Ansh Patel, Ali Ahmad, Naveed Ahmad, Annus Haider, Faisal Jan, Paramanyu Gupta, posh989, and others.

### Day 2

Breakout Room assignments: https://tinyurl.com/4py8abtu (Thanks for your patience in working through various issues.)

Homework for Thursday:

From the positron.tutorials package, complete the “Positron and GitHub Introduction” (04-github-1) tutorial.

From the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the “Data tidying” (05-data-tidying).

Don't worry about the difference between how you call a tutorial, with `05-data-tidying` and the default file name of the answers, which is `data-tidying.html`. Just accept the default file name for the answer.

DONT FORGET YOUR NAME, EMAIL, AND THE NUMBER OF MINUTES!
STUDENTS WHO DON'T SUBMIT AT LEAST 04-github-1 BEFORE 7:00 PM TOMORROW WON'T BE GIVEN A ZOOM LINK.

0) Big thanks to all the students (including YouSeeABee, Naveed Ahmad, Faisal Jan, Aftab A. Ali Mukhi, Ahmed, Ansh Patel, M Numan, umaira, and others) answering questions on Discord! You are a good person to do so. And, also, you only really understand something once you have explained it to someone else. See. Do. Teach. 

1) Change your Discord and Zoom display name to be the name which we should use in addressing you. We are a community! 

2) Make friends with the students in your breakout room. If you miss class, you can check with them about what happened. And it is OK to miss class on occasion. You have other obligations! But email Navya and your TF ahead of time so that we know. (TF emails available on the staff page.)

3) Never stress about the tutorials! Just do your best. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Ask lots of questions on Discord.

4) In the breakout rooms, one person shares a screen and the others tell her what to type. Then, next time, someone else shares and a different person "drives." If you are sharing your screen, you never type anything unless you are told explicitly to do so.

6) Do not start working on the primer.tutorials tutorials, which are due next week. We are still writing them. If you want to get ahead, work on the tutorials from r4ds.tutorials and positron.tutorials.

6) In the first class, we worked on script. Today, we work from a Quarto document. 


### Day 3

Next year: Install primer.data together. Then, install primer.tutorials. Show options download time trick.

1) Homework due Monday (updated!):

* Read Chapter 1 Rubin Causal Model and complete the “Rubin Causal Model” tutorial (011-rubin-causal-model) from the primer.tutorials package. THIS IS REALLY GOOD!

* From the positron.tutorials package, complete the “Positron and GitHub Advanced” (05-github-2) tutorial.

* From the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the “Data import” (07-data-import) tutorial.

2) If you need to miss class, email Navya and your TF. Missing class (on occasion) is OK! School, family and prom (!) come first. Not submitting your homework will cause me to remove you from the course.

3) Ask lots of questions on Discord. Other students benefit from both your question and the resulting answers. Answer lots of questions on Discord! Your fellow students (and I) appreciate it. Moreover, you only really understand something once you have taught it. See. Do. Teach. Thanks to Ansh Patel, Rashid, Naveed Ahmad, YouSeeABee, Jeff Swensen and others for participating on Discord!

4) For picking final projects, ask yourself some questions: What topic are you most interested in? What do you follow on social media? What do you care about even though no one is forcing you to care about it? Tell us, and we can help you find relevant data. Use the #final-projects channel on Discord. Also, I am trying an experiment in which I will personally work with a small number of students who are interested in performing a replication of an academic article as their final project. Email if you are interested in this.

5) Before you start a new Primer tutorial, run:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")

Do not start the Primer tutorials which are due next week until Saturday. (We will make an announcement on the #course-annoucements channel.) We are re-writing them.

6) Professional data scientists use GitHub. Goal today is to publish our two graphics from Monday and Wednesday (and other graphics as well?). See the #class-work channel.

7) You must catch up with all homework, including the three tutorials due for Monday's class, by midnight EDT on Sunday. 




## Week 2

Monday: Get the data downloaded and placed in a data directory.

Wednesday: Fork the repo from Monday, read in the data. Explore and understand the data. Maybe make some rough plots.

Thursday: Use the same project as Wednesday. Make a nice plot. Publish it.

See the daily scripts for more details. Key things this week are getting comfortable with rendering qmd, using Git/Github and then publishing the page to the web. 

Review RCM and probability.


### Day 4

Call me "Preceptor."

No eight week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

0) Tell your TF and Navya (not me) if you will be missing a class, need an extension on the assignments and so on. They are nice people! They will always say "Yes," but you need to tell/ask them.

1) Big thanks to those (including Abdul Hannan, Yasir Khan, Muhammad Numan, **Hassan Ali**, Naveed Ahmad and others) pointing our typos and errors in the tutorials, and to those helping out their classmates. Much appreciated!

2) Homework for Wednesday:

  * Read Chapter 2 Probability and complete the “Probability” tutorial (021-probability) from the primer.tutorials package.

  * From the positron.tutorials package, complete the “Quarto Websites Introduction” (06-websites-1) tutorial.

  * From the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the and “Layers” (09-layers) tutorial.

3) Before you start a new Primer tutorial, run:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")

The other packages are stable and don't need to be reinstalled.

4) Key goal today is to practice some of the techniques you learned in the Terminal tutorial. You completed that right . . .

5) File we will be using:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.data/master/data-raw/nyc_tracts.csv 

6) This is sloppy. Stop doing it:

Removing file(s) '05-github-2_answers - Junaid(1).html' due to missing key variables. Removing file(s) 'data-import_answers - Junaid(1).html' due to missing key variables. Removing file(s) 'rubin-causal-model_answers - Muhammad Numan.html' due to missing key variables.

7) Make your Zoom and Discord display name the same thing as how you want to be addressed.

8) If you are using Windows and your Terminal does not look like mine: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started-with-positron.html#the-terminal

### Day 5

0) Homework for Thursday:

Read Chapter 3 Sampling and complete the “Sampling” tutorial (031-sampling) from the primer.tutorials package. (This is the last chapter you should read in the Primer.)

From the positron.tutorials package, complete the “Quarto Websites Advanced” (07-websites-2) tutorial.

Read Cardinal Virtues.

1) Uhappy with your Zoom room? No worries! Not all students work well together. Email Navya and your TF together and they will adjust.

2) Thanks to everyone (Naveed Ahmad, Paramanyu Gupta, Hassan Ali, Rashid, Ansh Patel and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated!

3) Let's learn how to fork a repo: 

https://github.com/bootcamp-2025-06/nyc-census-tracts-to-fork

Fork it. Connect this it to a new project. Data science work often begins with a fork like this. 

4) Let's explore some of final projects from previous years: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html Take a look with your breakout room.

5) Come to class tomorrow with some thoughts on what you want to do your project on and where you will get the data for it.

6) "Hey my problem got resolved." Tell us how!

7) "Would it be okay if I didn’t come to class tonight and just completed all due homework (that of tonight and for tomorrow) by Thursday?" Always YES! Just ask your TFs, while cc'ing Navya.

8) Let's make a website!

### Day 6

1)Homework (THIS IS A CHANGE. REFRESH THE SCHEDULE PAGE.):

Note that chapters 4 and higher from the Primer are a mess, using packages/functions which we no longer recommend. We are re-writing the Primer this summer. In the meantime, don’t feel obligated to read any more of it, although you do have to complete the tutorials, which are up-to-date. We just list the chapters in this schedule for your reference.

* Complete the “Models” tutorial (041-models) from the primer.tutorials package.

* Read chapters 1 – 3 from from Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R by Kyle Walker.

* From the tidycensus.tutorials package, complete the “An introduction to tidycensus” (02-introduction) and “Wrangling Census data with Tidyverse tools” (03-wrangling) tutorials.

* Come to class with the url for at least one data source you will be using for your Data Project.

2) Always reinstall the primer.tutorials package before starting a new tutorial. 

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")

If you fail to do this, you will be doing garbage.

3) Thanks to Ansh Patel, Ali Ahmad and others for pointing out errors in the tutorials. This is very helpful to us. Future students will thank you!

4) Same data location: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.data/master/data-raw/nyc_tracts.csv

5) Run `/nick yourname` to change your Discord name in this server. 

6) Data Project presentations (Demo Day) on Thursday July 10. Read more: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

7) Figure out this weekend a topic for your Data Project, and at least one url with some data. You will need to share that with your classmates on Monday, although you can change your topic later. 



## Week 3

Las week, we started with nothing, created a project, downloaded some data, read in the data, did some wrangling, made a nice plot and put it on the web. Good stuff! 

This week, we do it all again, but with a Quarto website. Not sure if we should try to do multiple websites, one each day. Or just do one. Or do three, but make them increasingly complex. Goal is to make it more likely that their projects go well.





### Day 7

0) Enter your data project topic and at least one url with relevant data now: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DjxXJE-bWXpNB_yPI19siZDlGGRTFT9_mIn0Gvob7UE/edit?usp=sharing

1) MAKE SURE TO REINSTALL primer.tutorials

> remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
> remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")

Check that this works by running:

> packageVersion("primer.tutorials")

Answer should be >= 1.4.9000.

2) Homework:

Complete the "Two Parameters" tutorial (`051-two-parameters`) from the [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/) package. 

* Read chapters 4 and 5 from from [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html) by Kyle Walker. 

* From the [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) package, complete the "Exploring US Census data with visualization" (`04-exploring`) and "Census geographic data and applications in R" (`05-geographic`) tutorials.  

3) Want to do an unpaid data science internship with me this summer? You now have enough background to do so, starting either now (while you take the course) or after the course ends. More details: https://davidkane.substack.com/p/data-science-apprenticeships. This is only open to people with 30+ hours per week available -- in addition to the 10 you already spend on the course. Email me to discuss. Anish, Ivy, Aashna are working with me now. Feel free to ask them about the experience.

4) Use AI more!

5) If you are ahead of your group, then work harder! Data download should be in a separate script, as should graphic creation. Expand the analysis to the whole state, or the whole country. Do more! 

### Day 8

1) Homework for Thursday:

Complete the “Three Parameters: Causal” tutorial (061-three-parameters-causal) from the primer.tutorials package.

Leaving you time to start thinking about your project!

2) Not sure what to do for your project? Use Census data!

3) Email your TF(s) now (cc Aadhira) to confirm that you will be there and to request a private meeting to discuss your project. See https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/staff.html for emails.

4) Read the instructions for Demo Day: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

5) Today, we will make another website, and create another map. We will try the leaflet package. You might need to install it.

6) Big thanks to Naveed Ahmad, Darakhshan, Ali Ahmad, **Ansh Patel** and others for pointing out tutorials errors. Future students thank you!

Class repo: 
Class website: 


### Day 9

1) Reinstall primer.tutorials

> remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
> remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")

2) Homework for Monday:

* From the primer.tutorials package, complete the “Project” tutorial (991-project) before class, or you will be removed the course. There are no extensions for this assignment.

Link to spreadsheet mentioned in tutorial: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JuIMh0_HaJ1YNVy7LXYl6Y3iKTNwcLZAdZdjRRqwbSk/edit?usp=sharing

* From the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the “Exploratory data analysis” (10-exploratory-data-analysis) and the “Communication” (11-communication) tutorials.

* You must have a draft of your final project, including a Quarto website and your paragraph introduction.

3) You have read the Demo Day guide, right? https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

4) We will send out invitation emails to our friends and/or family on Monday in class. Decide who you want to invite. Make sure you have their email addresses. I urge you to invite your grandparents. They love you!

5) Let's look at weather! Check out #announcements channel for the NYT graphic which serves as inspiration.

Class Github: 
Class website: 



## Week 4

Note that this will be week 3 next time, without the data science stuff.

Key goal is to show them how to build a final project, from start to finish. First day is just building a Quarto website. This should go fairly fast since they all should have done it in the tutorial already. We do the exact same thing on days 11 and 12, going faster each time and leaving more time for discussion and playing around with the resulting website. 

Whole thing worked very well last time. It is really good to make them comfortable making websites. It is really good to show them how to split out component parts in scripts like download-data.R and make-plots.R.


### Day 10

Demo Day Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn
Demo Day Projects: https://shorturl.at/guyh3 
Demo Day Zoom: https://shorturl.at/dafDQ

0) Thanks to Eric, Rajeev, Akhil B, shibaaaaaa, Melody, Deepak, Sanaka, SriRitvik, Iris Li, Ronit Dash, John Menzies (especially!) and others for their participation on Discord. Much appreciated!

1) Confirm your attendance (or otherwise) on the Demo Day Room Assignment Sheet: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn

2) Check out the data projects: https://shorturl.at/guyh3 Add your material, even just your name, if you have not already. We need to know who is presenting.

3) All my/TF comments today will seem more critical than we intend them to be. Sorry! We love your projects and all the hard work you have done. Our comments are meant to be constructive, but they will mostly be things you should change . . .

4) You must invite at least one friend or family member to Demo Day. You must bcc Tejas (tejasnm07 at gmail.com) and your TF when you send the email.

Below is a draft email. Modify as you like. We will send this email during class tonight.

---
Please come watch me present my final project for Kane’s Data Science Course at 8:00 PM EDT on Thursday, June 27. Links: 

Zoom: https://shorturl.at/dafDQ
(Draft) Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn
Background: http://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

I don't know whether I will be presenting at 8:00 or 8:30, but I can update you about that on Wednesday.

No worries if you can't make it!
---

4) Goal today is to take a look at everyone's draft project. We will do practice presentations on Wednesday and then public presentations on Thursday. 

5) Make sure to read and follow the Style Guide: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html

6) Make sure you have as many lines of comments as you have lines of code. There is no better way to distinguish between student and professional code than by looking at the comments.

7) Consider splitting your project up, as you learned to do in the Quarto Websites tutorial. You don't want your index.qmd file to take a lot of time to process. Use scripts for data download/cleaning and for graphic creation.



### Day 11

Demo Day Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/KLlVn
Demo Day Projects: https://shorturl.at/guyh3 
Demo Day Zoom: https://shorturl.at/dafDQ

1) Thank your TFs! Run this code:

```
Sys.Date() + runif(n = 1, min = 365*5, max = 365*6)
```

This is a random day sometime in the range of 5 to 6 years from now. Add a note in your calendar for that date to send us a thank you email, letting your TF know what you are up to, with data science or anything else. Good teachers love to hear from their former students!

2) We will complete this survey in class: https://forms.gle/HWRyTLAjxQxxz5hF9

3) Get ready for vacation! Don't start the primer.tutorials assignments until Wednesday July 10. And, when you start them, make sure to reinstall the package.

4) If you are eager to do some stuff during the vacation, all the r4ds.tutorials are ready to go although, as always, you should reinstall (with remotes:: ...) each time you start a new tutorial. But, before starting any r4ds.tutorials, make sure to 

`install.packages("tutorial.helpers", type = "source")`.

In fact, you should probably do that now. No worries if it fails. Background is that I just released to CRAN a new version of tutorial.helpers which includes show_file(). The package is so new that binary versions of not available yet. That is why we need to use type = "source". If that command fails for you, just wait till this week-end and use just install.packages("tutorial.helpers").

5) Your data for tomorrow is whatever it is. No worries. But your data for the Final Project must be rich enough to allow for the creation of a statistical model. Advice: https://davidkane.info/writings/data-for-projects.html

6) The main project today is to have one person in your breakout room volunteer to have her data project replicated. That means, that everyone else in the group will fork her repo, connect it to an R project on their computer, and then run quarto preview and quarto publish. Good data science is replicable by others. 

In doing this, some warnings. First, delete _publish.yml and rsconnect if the student has (mistakenly) included in in her repo. (She should have included those in her .gitignore file.) Second, it is possible that the student failed to include her data in the repo. Or that she hard-coded some file paths. In any event, trying to replicate someone else's work is a valuable exercise, as is watching/helping someone else trying to rpelicate your work. If someone in the group is having trouble with the replication, help him. If everyone can replicate one student's work, then another student should volunteer. Then, the forking/replication exercise is repeated.

7) Everyone should practice saying (NOT READING) their one paragraph introduction.




# Part 2

The goal for this part for students to be able to take a question and a data set, and then create a statistical model to answer that question. The final result is an high quality website which presents the model and the results. Most important reference: 


## Week 5

Keep in mind that talking about the Cardinal Virtues and a new data science project takes a lot of time. Just having students write down a description of a Preceptor Table is a 5+ minute exercise in the breakout rooms. Try to do Wisdome/Justice on Monday, Courage on Wednesday and Temperance on Thursday, finishing with a Rpubs. (Encourage ambitious students to make a Quarto website.)


On day 1, it is hard to go beyond just describing the Preceptor Table. That is hard for students to do! Maybe next time don't even bother to set up the project till Day 14. Just descibe the questions, the Preceptor Table. Then I describe the data, then ask them to come up with reasons why all the assumptions fail.

### Day 13

Call me Preceptor.

No course does more to increase your odds of getting the future you want.

The central metaphor for this class is Ulysses and the Sirens. You are Ulysses. Ithaca is the future you want. The Sirens are the many distractions of the modern world. I am the rope. 

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today, we start with Wisdom and, I hope, Justice.

1) Start thinking about the data for your Model Project: https://davidkane.info/writings/data-for-projects.html

2) Welcome to our new TFs: Gia Khang and Sanaka Dash!

3) Start a data science project. Repo -> Project -> Quarto Document. Download the data from https://shorturl.at/H0cju. Put in a data/ directory. Edit .gitignore. Commit/push everything. Read in the data. 

4) What is the broad topic/question we are interested in? What is the specific question we will answer? Useful reference: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html#question

5) Describe the Preceptor Table in words. Hint: Think in terms of units, outcomes, covariates, treatments. Useful reference: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html#preceptor-table

6) Explore the data.

7) Write down one reason why validity might not hold.

8) Also, find a reason why stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness might not hold.

Class website: 
Class Github: 
AI Log:

Add Discord post information.


### Day 14

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today, we finish Wisdom and Justice

1) You must have a dataset with an outcome variable and more than 2 covariates by tomorrow. Reminder: https://davidkane.info/writings/data-for-projects.html

2) Zoom work is the same as always. Someone is always sharing a screen. That person does not talk. They just type what the "driver" tells them to type. Everyone else is also typing. Switch the "sharer" and the "driver" often, certainly at least every time we go back to the main room.

3) We will fork this repo: https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/prep-2024-07-17

4) No code today! We are trying to understand conceptual issues. Best guide: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/cardinal-virtues.html

5) If your group answers the assigned questions quickly (I will only assign a couple at a time), then load the data and start exploring it. Don't rush through all the questions at once.


### Day 15

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today, we finish with Courage and Temperance.

Goal complete a published Rpubs analysis of the resume experiment. 

1) Repo to fork to begin: https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/prep-resume

2) From Discord: "I mean idk how to delete and reinstall a tutorial" 

Arrg. I have only specified this several times in the Preceptor Notes. Reminder:

```
remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

3) We will discuss model project data sources on Monday. Too much to do today!

4) Courage means coming up with a model. Temperance means using the fitted model, the data generating mechanism, to answer our question.


## Week 6

### Day 16

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. 

1) Please fill out this spreadsheet: https://shorturl.at/mqKea. It is OK if you are not certain what your outcome variable is or which covariates you plan to use. We just want to get a sense of what is in your data. (There should be at least two covariates which help to explain your outcome variable.)

2) See #course-announcements channel for information about this week's data source.

Frederick Mosteller (1995) “The Tennessee study of class size in the early school grades.” The Future of Children, vol. 5, no. 2, pp. 113–127. Data cleaned and discussed in "Quantitative Social Science: An Introduction" by Kosuke Imai.

3) Please refresh the schedule page weekly. We do make changes! https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html

4) Today we consider Wisdom and Justice. Courage follows on Wednesday, Temperance on Thursdays.


### Day 17

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Today is Courage. Tomorrow is Temperance.

1) Check out the repo from Monday: https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/class-size. Note that the repo is always added to the Preceptor's Notes for that class, after the class is over and I clean things up a bit. Check out my answers to the questions. They aren't the only answers, but they are good.

2) Check out this #course-announcement: https://shorturl.at/f1VTX

3) We need to modify our variables so that things are easier to understand when we create our model.

### Day 18

Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Wednesday was Courage. Today is Temperance.

1) Two plots we might make today: https://shorturl.at/qQiov

2) If your breakout room is fast, try to make a nice looking html and publish it to Rpubs. Put a link in the #course-work channel if you succeed. Follow the strategy given in the tutorials, i.e., write a paragraph, add the mathematics of the model, create a gtsummary table and create some nice plots.

3) You don't have to make your code look like mine, but here is my key code from the first two days. Feel free to just copy it so that you are caught up.

AI Log:


## Week 7

Using the governors data set.

### Day 19

1) Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Today is Wisdom and Justice. Wednesday is Courage. Thursday is Temperance.

2) Make sure the project spreadsheet is up-to-date: https://shorturl.at/mqKea

3) Homework for Wednesday (chapters 24 and 25) and Thursday (chapters 26 and 27) from R for Data Science.

4) For Wednesday, you must have the results of a call to brm() which you can share with us. 

5) Background on this week's class exercise:

Barfort, S., Klemmensen, R., and Larsen, E. G. (2021). Longevity returns to political office. Political Science Research and Methods 9, 658–664.

https://github.com/PPBDS/primer.data/blob/master/inst/papers/governors.pdf

Does political office cause worse or better longevity prospects? Two perspectives in the literature offer contradicting answers. First, increased income, social status, and political connections obtained through holding office can increase longevity. Second, increased stress and working hours associated with holding office can have detrimental effects on longevity. To provide causal evidence, we exploit a regression dis- continuity design with unique data on the longevity of candidates for US gubernatorial office. The results show that politicians winning a close election live 5–10 years longer than candidates who lose.

### Day 20

1) Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Today is Courage. Tomorrow is Temperance.

2) There is a new version of gtsummary available. Please re-install to be sure that you have it:

```
install.packages("gtsummary")
```

3) My setup code chunk:

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(primer.data)
library(brms)
library(tidybayes)
library(gtsummary)

x <- governors |> 
  select(death_age, election_age, win_margin, sex) |> 
  mutate(treatment = ifelse(win_margin > 0, "win", "lose")) |> 
  filter(abs(win_margin) < 5) 
```

### Day 21

1) Spaced repetition is our friend: Wisdom, Justice, Courage, Temperance. Monday was Wisdom and Justice. Wednesday was Courage. Today is Temperance.

2) Last homework assignment is Model Project tutorial from primer.tutorials. DO NOT START IT YET. I will finish it by Saturday at midnight and put an note in the #annoucements channel. But no worries. You can't even start this tutorial until you have a draft of your project. Do you have one yet?

3) Put your brm() call and a fixef() of the resulting object into the #projects channel. If you bracket the code with three backticks, it will look nice.

4) I updated the Temperance section of the Cardinal Virtues chapter with a discussion about scaling and intervals. Highly recommended! https://shorturl.at/EXyPu

5) See the analysis.qmd file in my repo if you want a working version of the Courage code from Wednesday.

## Week 8

### Day 1

* Positron, a next-generation data science IDE, will replace RStudio in the next few years, mainly because it works as well with Python as it does with R. It is the future. The next version of this course will probably use it. I recommend you all take a look: https://github.com/posit-dev/positron

* The official definition of completing this class is having a final project listed here: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html

* In order to get your final project listed, you must complete the spreadsheet: https://shorturl.at/6w8vT

* We expect you to present your project on Thursday (Zoom link: https://shorturl.at/WaBub). It is OK if you can't present because of family or other obligations, but, if so, you must email Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) now to tell him so he can set up the breakout rooms correctly.

* Make sure you comment your code: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html#comments

* We are missing some TFs today, so we will need to move Luit's, Anish's, and Vaangmaya's  students to other breakout rooms. Thanks for your flexibility.

* DON'T PANIC! Even if your project is a disaster, there is still time to fix it! First, schedule a meeting with your TF. Second, ask a question on Discord. We are here to help. Third, go to Tejas' office hours tomorrow. Fourth, start with a small sample of your data and a model with just one covariate. (You only need about 1,000 rows for each parameter.) Get that working and then increase the complexity. Fifth, start over! You have my permission to use a data set from a course and make a model similar to (but not identical with!) one of the examples in the course.

* Goal today is to take a tour of various projects. This is mostly TFs sharing their screen and giving feedback on everyone's project. But they will also ask other students to contribute their comments. Be ready to participate. If your room goes fast, then have everyone try to replicate one student's project by forking and then building it themselves. Highly recommended!

### Day 2

* Tell me a number (with a sensible number of signficant digits), and your certainity about that number. Every summary sentence should do this. Data science means numbers, and uncertainty!

* Confirm your participation in Demo Day here: https://shorturl.at/LMVRO

* Make sure that you arrive no later than 7:50 for class tomorrow. Because I have a new Zoom account, I am somewhat concerned about participation limits, so I want to ensure that no students get locked out.

* I am considering teaching two different courses this fall. 

  + This class, but over the course of 12 weeks, with less work each week.
  + An introductory philosophy class which would read some Great Books and then use generative AI to create cool multimedia essays/art.
  
However, I am not sure who would take either class. As you can see, most of my students are in high school or college. Such students are usually too busy to work during the fall semester. I suspect that the most likely potential students would be either home-schooled or at private/charter school (with flexible rules) which might be willing to work with me to teach a group of their students )(for free) all at once.

If you know someone who might be interested (like your uncle works at a high school), please have them email me (dave.kane@gmail.com) to discuss. I will also send out a message about this to the Substack list this week-end.

* Below is a draft email. Modify as you like. We will send this email during class tonight.

Please come watch me present my final project for Kane’s Data Science Course at 8:00 PM EDT on Thursday, August 8. Links: 

Zoom: https://shorturl.at/WaBub
Room Assignments: https://shorturl.at/LMVRO
Projects: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html
Background: http://bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

I don't know whether I will be presenting at 8:00 or 8:30, but I can update you about that before the presentation.

No worries if you can't make it!
---

* We will do a quick dry run of the start of Demo Day tonight. First, we will all go out to the correct rooms, just to be sure that we can get there. Second, TFs will then adjust room placement depending on who is absent. (They will do this, either by moving someone from the "last" room to the missing spot or, better, by assigning a TF to fill that spot. When the latter happens, the TF will always be in Group B.)

* Then, after some time in the main room, we will practice our presentations a couple of times BUT GOING IN REVERSE ORDER, the better to see different students present. Of course, tomorrow we will go in the correct order. Give good feedback to each other!
