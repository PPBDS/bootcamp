# This is a collection of Preceptor's Notes for use before class. 
# Also included are notes to TFs. And notes for me? 
# This is a text document because the contents need to be copy/pasted into Discord.


## Outline

See the big_picture.txt file.

End of week 1, Github/Rpubs using library data
End of week 2, Github/Rpubs using downloaded data
End of week 3, Github/Quarto Website using downloaded census data, perhaps with several different scripts and saved images.


## Standard Preparations

* Reach out to potential TFs. Check to see if any are interested in younger or older breakout rooms.

* Set up new Github organization under your personal account. Use this for class repos. Follow bootcamp-2023-01 as a naming convention https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024

* Create a new location for example reprexes at Posit Community. Here is the most recent one: https://forum.posit.co/t/thread-for-students-posting-practice-reprexes-please-do-not-answer-them/187087

* Update link in Getting Help tutorial with this new location.

* Update link in Data Project tutorial which goes to the spreadsheet students fill out.

* Update link in Terminal for rtools.

* Set up empty project for first class so your set up looks like student set up.

* Be careful about forks. If you have students fork from repo class-2022-08-01, you can not then change the name of this tutorial to class-2022-08-02 and then have them fork from it again. The reason is that these are the same repo, but with a name change, and you can't fork twice from the same repo.

# First TF Meeting

Confirm that everyone can see #staff channel and that their Discord display name is sensible.

Confirm that everyone has a sensible Zoom display name.

Anyone interested in Older breakout room? Younger room?

We will be making extensive use of AI. I recommend the free version of ChatGPT. Unless you feel strongly, use this so students can do the same. But, if you are using a paid version of this, or another AI, that is fine to. Will be interesting to see if it is better.

Thanks to Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) for volunteering to be Head TF. Email him now (or as soon as you know) when you will be missing class.

Show breakout room spreadsheet, including TF schedule sheet.


## Constructing Breakout Rooms

The Head TFs are not assigned to breakout rooms. They, along with me, visit lots of rooms and/or cover for missing TFs.

The breakout room spreadsheet should be organized with these columns:

Room #, TF, name, email

Each room should have X + 2 rows, where X is defined at the total number of students divided by the number of regular (not Head) TFs. It is OK that rows are blank. It does not matter how long the spreadsheet is since students only look at their rooms. It is very convenient that we have students' names and emails together. 

The Room # is repeated across all rows. Under the TF column, there are just two rows. First row is TF name. Second row is TF email. This is repeated for each of the 3 (?) rooms that TFs start with. But the remaining X - 2 rows under TF are blank.

Each TF has 3 rooms, all in order. With too many students, one might expand this to 4 or more rooms. But there is no need for it ever to be fewer than 3.

In our initial interactions with students (maybe a form that they need to submit?), we ask them if they are young (<-15) or old (25>=). Grouping students by age is useful, I think. We also ask if there is a friend (give us the name and email) with whom they would like to be grouped. As long as we are doing a form, we should ask a couple of questions about background. Would it be useful to group by ability? Maybe?

Assume each TF starts with 12 (or X) students on the first day. All are placed in the first room. (The 2nd and 3rd rooms are left empty.) This will be crowded, but there are so many messed up students, that it is OK. This also gives the TF a chance to clearly demonstrate how the course should be run. Tell someone to share their screen. If they are messed up somehow, switch to a different person. Ask another person to drive. If they are clueless, no worries! Just say, "No worries. John (new person), why don't you direct Sarah?" If John is clueless, switch immediately to a new person. After a few minures, have a different person share their screen. Choose a different driver. Never share your screen. Never waste time with people who are having weird difficulties.

On Day 2, the TF herself edits the spreadsheet, assigning 6 (or X/2) students to her first two rooms. We leave the last room empty, for now. 

After the first week (?), we make permanent assignments, potentially re-arranging students, including moving students to the third room. We want the smallest rooms possible, but only if we can expect at least 2 students to always be there. For example, the TF might (or might not) move things around, perhaps by taking the 4 weakest (or strongest) students and moving them to the third room. 

Key: TFs run their own shows! They are in charge of their students and their rooms. They should do what they think best. But, some flexibility is always needed, not least when the Head TF needs to move students from one TF to another.

## TF Schedule Tab

The second spreadsheet tab on the breakout room spreadsheet goes to a tab which shows the TF attendance schedule. First column is TF name. Second column is TF room numbers. 3rd and succeeding columns are dates of classes. TFs indicate whether they are "Present" or "Out" for each day.


Code for creating the class list:

set.seed(9)
x |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(! information_name %in% c("Luit Deka", "Aditya Chaudhary", "Alan Cai", "Monish Malla", "Atharva Bir Dutta")) |> 
  slice_sample(prop = 1) |> 
  select(information_name, information_email) |>  
  distinct(information_email, .keep_all = TRUE) |> 
  write_csv("~/Downloads/class.csv") -> y
  

## Week 1

### Email with Zoom Link for First Class

This email is going out to all the students who have completed the first homework assignment. Please read it closely and follow all the instructions.

0) Call me "Preceptor," not "David" nor "Mr. Kane" nor "Bro."

1) Class today at 8:00 PM EST at 

https://harvard.zoom.us/j/92188147735?pwd=STOd2TSKEm2hVcpygA9NvbnwoA4wIr.1

Be early, not late. I will often shut the room at 8:01 and not allow anyone to attend late. Make sure that you have updated your Zoom client ahead of time.

2) Login in to our Discord server at:

https://discord.gg/GWPYn3pG

We distribute class material on Discord, so you must use it.

3) If you are 15 or younger (or 30 or older), please email Head TF Tejas (tejasnm07@gmail.com) with your name/email and age. We are organizing the groups by age, at least at the extremes. Even better is to DM Tejas this information on Discord itself.

4) To attend class on Wednesday, you must complete the homework for Wednesday by midnight on Tuesday. Feel free to start now.

I look forward to meeting you tonight!

Preceptor

### Day 1

#### Preceptor's Notes

Call me "Preceptor."

No eight week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

Video on --- unless there is something going on in your life which prevents it. In which case, discuss with a TF.

Class always begins by looking at the Preceptor's Notes for the day, available here, in Discord.

1) After today, we start on time, often by going to breakout rooms immediately. Let's go now! Introduce yourself to your fellow students with one sentence. TFs will try and swing by. Your room assignment is specified on the spreadsheet in the course #announcements channel on Discord.  

2) Links to consider today:

NYT article: https://shorturl.at/o4b0n
NYT article (pdf): https://shorturl.at/SBLCF

3) Update this package now from the R Console.

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/tutorial.helpers")
```

This should be the last time you need to mess with this package.

4) Submit the assignments or you will be removed from the class. Central metaphor of the class is Ulysses and the Sirens. There are several tutorials due on Wednesday before class. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Don't forget to answer the questions about your name, email and the number of minutes it took to complete the tutorial. 

Use the default name for your HTML submissions, e.g., `rstudio-and-code_answers.html`

5) Sign up for free version of chatGPT (https://chatgpt.com/), or the equivalent.

6) It is always a good idea to reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")
```



#### TF Notes

Check the spreadsheet for your students and breakout room assignments. We will need to move things around as TFs come and go. For example, Ethan will take over Nosa's rooms at some point.

Identify a final project or two which you like and which you think are well done. It is OK if one of the projects is yours. Indeed, you should probably clean up your own final project just in case students want to look at it!

You should do more talking/directing today than you will do later. Indeed, you are talking almost all the time when you are in a room today. (This is totally different from later in the session, when you might say very little, allowing students to run the breakout rooms themselves.) Tell a different student to share their screen each time. Tell another student to do the "driving," to tell the first student what to click on. 

Make sure your display name in Zoom includes the name by which you want students to address you. Encourage students to do the same. 

Make sure your display name in Discord is the name by which students know you, could be just your first name or your whole name. Should not be something opaque. Encourage studnets to do the same. 




### Day 2

#### Preceptor's Notes

0) Big thanks to e_jesse for pointing out typos/errors in the tutorials. Much appreciated!

1) If possible, please change your Discord and Zoom display name to be the name which we should use in addressing you. We are a community! 

2) Big thanks to all the students (including Ethan K, Memo$taylooted, Aedan, basing my data, Jammy_john, chezbanana25, and others) using Discord. Much appreciated, especially those answering questions! You are a good person to do so. And, also, you only really understand something once you have explained it to someone else. See. Do. Teach. 

3) Make friends with the students in your breakout room. If you miss class, you can check with them about what happened. And it is OK to miss class on occasion. You have other obligations! But email Tejas and your TF ahead of time so that we know.

4) It is always a good idea to reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

If you have problems, it is sometimes necessary to remove the package first:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")

5) Never stress about the tutorials! Just do your best. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Ask lots of questions on Discord.

6) In the breakout rooms, one person shares a screen and the others tell her what to type. Then, next time, someone else shares and a different person "drives." If you are sharing your screen, you never type anything unless you are told explicitly to do so.

7) Start thinking about the topic for your final project. What are you interested in? Is there data about it?

8) In the first class, we just worked from the Console. Today, we go "one level up" and work from a Quarto document within an R project. 



### Day 3

#### Preceptor's Notes

0) If you need to miss class, email Tejas and your TF. Missing class (on occasion) is OK! School, family and prom (!) come first. Not submitting your homework will cause me to remove you from the course.

1) Ask lots of questions on Discord. Other students benefit from both your question and the resulting answers. Answer lots of questions on Discord! Your fellow students (and I) appreciate it. Moreover, you only really understand something once you have taught it. See. Do. Teach.

2) Thanks to Ethan, SriRitvik, Eric, Leo, Thomas S, Ethan K, Shyamali Sheth and others for participating on Discord!

3) For picking final projects, ask yourself some questions: What topic are you most interested in? What do you follow on social media? What do you care about even though no one is forcing you to care about it? Tell us, and we can help you find relevant data. Use the #final-projects channel on Discord.

4) Before you start a new tutorial (but after you have finished/submitted other tutorials), run:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

5) In the first class, we just worked from the Console. On day 2, we went "one level up" and worked from a Quarto Document within an R project. Today, we go one more level up, start with Github.

6) Goal today is to publish an interesting graphic relating population to economic connectedness across US counties. See the #class-work channel.

7) You must catch up with all homework, including the three tutorials due for Monday's class, by midnight EDT on Sunday. 

Read Chapters 5, 6, and 7 from R for Data Science (2e), and from the r4ds.tutorials package, complete the tutorials associated with the readings: “Data Tidying,” “Terminal,” and “Data Import.”


## Week 2

Monday: Get the data downloaded and placed in a data directory.

Wednesday: Fork the repo from Monday, read in the data. Explore and understand the data. Maybe make some rough plots.

Thursday: Use the same project as Wednesday. Make a nice plot. Publish it to Rpubs.

See the daily scripts for more details. Key things this week are getting comfortable with rendering qmd, using Git/Github and then publishing the page to the web. 


### Day 4

Call me "Preceptor."

No eight week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

0) Tell your TF and Tejas (not me) if you will be missing a class, need an extension on the assignments and so on. They are nice people! They will always say "Yes," but you need to tell/ask them.

1) Big thanks to those (including Yesmine, Sophia Y, meow, Joshua, Nick, Natalie and others) pointing our typos and errors in the tutorials, and to those helping out their classmates. Much appreciated.

2) New version of tutorial.tidycensus is available. Install it now:

install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

2) Whenever starting a new R4DS tutorial, please:

install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

Do it now! (Never hurts.) And restart R with Command-shift-0. Note that this is zero not the letter O.


3) Key goal today is to practice some of the techniques you learned in the Terminal tutorial. You completed that right . . .

4) File we will be using:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PPBDS/primer.data/master/data-raw/nyc_tracts.csv 

5) This is sloppy. Stop doing it:

Removing file(s) 'data-import_answers - aditya raut - Aditya Raut.html', 'data-import_answers - astrxr.html', 'data-import_answers - Ethan Koshy.html', 'data-tidying_answers - Ethan Koshy.html', 'data-tidying_answers - kushal kanuparthi.html', 'terminal_answers - Ivy S.html', 'terminal_answers - Kushagra Singh.html', 'terminal_answers - kushal kanuparthi.html', 'terminal_answers - Phanithan K(1).html' due to missing key variables.

6) Make your Zoom and Discord display name the same thing as how you want to be addressed.

### Day 5

-1) Thanks to everyone (Alan Tao, Pranav C, Rishi S, vibha24, ricesucker2000, Pratham, and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated! Also, thanks to everyone for pointing out errors in the tutorials. 

0) Sign up for https://chat.openai.com/ now.

1)  Always reinstall the tutorials before starting a new tutorial. It certain weird situations, it may be necessary to explicitly remove and then reinstall:

remove.packages("r4ds.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

2) Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state?

3) Posit Cloud (https://posit.cloud/) is an option for people with computer problems. (Posit is the company behind RStudio.) 

4) Whenever you, after asking a question on Discord, figure something out, please edit/update your question with the correct answer.

5) Let's learn how to delete a repo. Keep your Github account clean.

6) Let's learn how to fork a repo: 

https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2023/class-2023-06-12

Connect this to a new RStudio project. Data science work often begins with a fork like this. Is there a relationship between the total population in a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in the state?



### Day 6


1) Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state? See #class-work channel for my plot.

2) Final Project presentations (Demo Day) on Wednesday July 12.

3) Call me "Preceptor."

4) Data Elixir (https://dataelixir.com/) and Data is Plural (https://www.data-is-plural.com/) are great sources for data. 

5) Always reinstall the r4ds.tutorials package before starting a new tutorial.

6) Let's get to know each other better. Go to the breakout rooms and have everyone say where they are and how they found out about the course.


## Week 3

Las week, we started with nothing, created a project, downloaded some data, read in the data, did some wrangling, made a nice plot and put it on the web. Good stuff! 

This week, we do it all again. In the next session, we should ensure that we do Census I for Monday. Then, this week's project builds a nice map of census data. 





### Day 7

1) Thanks to everyone (Rishi S, Alan Tao, Alan Cai, vibha24, susuwatari, cindyqiao, satvik, Aryan, Pratham, Luit Deka  and others) for asking/answering questions on Discord. Much appreciated! Also, thanks to everyone for pointing out errors in the tutorials. 

2) Want to do a data science apprenticeship with me this summer? You now have enough background to do so, starting either now (while you take the course) or after the course ends. More details: https://davidkane.substack.com/p/data-science-apprenticeships

3) Happy Git and GitHub for the useR is an incredible resource: https://happygitwithr.com/. 

4) Discuss your ideas for projects. Look at what students have done in prior sessions: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html

5) Review schedule for this week: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html

Class Github: 
Class website: 

### Day 8

0) Make sure you complete the Quarto Websites (chapter 7) tutorial for Thursday class. We will be making a website in class tomorrow.

1) If you are using Posit Cloud, make sure to understand how it works and to set up everything before class.

2) There are lots of CRAN packages which specialize in different types of data. Google is your friend! Examples:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/worldfootballR/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oce/index.html

3) Lots of cool stuff at CRAN Task Views: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ 

4) Please

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

before you start the tutorial. Of course, you should do this before each tutorial, including tutorials from other packages like primer.tutorials and tidycensus.tutorials.

5) Apologies that we are working on the tutorials now, but, as I mentioned at the start, we are making major changes in the course this session.

Class Github: 
Class website: 

### Day 9

0) Ask questions in public Discord. Don't DM me (except for personal issues). Why? I want other people to check out your approach. Maybe there is something for them to learn! I also want them to try to answer questions. That is how you really learn.

1) If you are having trouble making quarto websites (see the discussion in the ⁠tutorials channel), you may want to update your Quarto installation. Go here to do so: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/. Run `quarto -v` from the Terminal to see what version you are using.

2) If you are using Windows, make sure that you installed RTools, as instructed in the Getting Started Chapter in the Primer.

3) Update all the tutorials, including all.primer and tidycensus.

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/tidycensus.tutorials")

Class Github: 
Class website: 


## Week 4

Note that this will be week 3 next time, without the data science stuff.

Key goal is to show them how to build a final project, from start to finish. First day is just building a Quarto website. This should go fairly fast since they all should have done it in the tutorial already. We do the exact same thing on days 11 and 12, going faster each time and leaving more time for discussion and playing around with the resulting website. 

Whole thing worked very well last time. It is really good to make them comfortable making websites. It is really good to show them how to split out component parts in scripts like download-data.R and make-plots.R.


### Day 10

-1) Students in Room 6 (normally) should move to Room 5 for today.

0) Thanks to shah nawaz, cindyqiao, Gaurinath Subash, Nick, vibha24, Rishi S, susuwatari and others for doing such a great job on Discord. Much appreciated! 

1) What is the causal effect of male age on female age across US counties? Think about the units, outcomes, covariates and (sometimes) treatments. What are the potential outcomes? Go to breakout rooms, share a screen, and write down some answers. Everyone write. I will call on students at random when we come back to the main room.

2) Let's make a website, and hope it works this time!

3) Some useful download code:

```
library(tidycensus)
x <- get_decennial(geography = "county", 
                   variables = c(population = "P001001", 
                                 med_age_male = "P013002", 
                                 med_age_female = "P013003"), 
                   year = 2010, 
                   output = "wide")
```



4) Create a scatter plot which of male median ages versus female median ages across US counties.


Class Github: 
Class website: 

### Day 11

0) Always start a data science project the same way: New Repo -> New R project -> New Quarto Document.

What is the average causal effect of hearing Spanish on attitudes toward immigration among students in this class? 

Write down the units, treatments and outcomes. What does the Preceptor Table look like?

1) Grab the latest version of the **primer.data** package, if necessary

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.data")

But you probably already have the latest version.

2) Explore the `trains` tibble. This was used extensively in Chapter 1 of the Primer. Focus on the key variables: treatment, att_end, gender. Look at the help page.

3) Recall some of the key concepts to doing data science: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/glossary.html

Class Github: 


### Day 12

0) We need the rstanarm library. If `library(rstanarm)` fails, you need to install it with `install.packages("rstanarm")`.

1) Fill out your name and email on this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12K7i51n9IOVlPbZ6gSEp2UUiC5vLZSr86X6hDM3E3CU/edit?usp=sharing

Later in class, we will give you time to add information about your final project.

2) You must have your final project data ready to work with for Monday's class!

3) Consider the schedule: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html

4) The Key Concept page is very handy: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/glossary.html



## Week 5

For next time, note that you can only get through Wisdom and Justice in the first day this week. There is so much to talk about! But, given that, you can start with a model which has two indepedent varables even though the students will not have officially read that chapter until Wednesday.

Also, the pulse ~ gender and age seems like a good model to work with. Or maybe save that addition for Thursday. That is, on Wednesday, just do Courage and Temperance for the model pulse ~ 1 model we started with. Then, on Thursday do a full model from start to finish, sort of an example for their final projects. 


### Day 13

0) Make sure you have filled out this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12K7i51n9IOVlPbZ6gSEp2UUiC5vLZSr86X6hDM3E3CU

1) Is your outcome really an "outcome?" It must be a variable, some column in the data which you propose to use. It must be possible to explain/predict using some other variables (the covariates) in the data you have. Most of the current outcomes are not outcomes . . . Example: "NBA Best Starting Lineup based on 2022-23 Stats" is not an outcome.

2) Once you have a model which uses the variables you have to model/forecast the outcome, then you can use that model to answer all sorts of interesting questions. For example, if you have a measure of basketball skill (as an outcome) which can be modeled as a function of covariates, then you can use that model to predict/explain skill in the future. Such a model could be used to, for example, predict the 5 best players next year.

3) It is often a good idea to start with an interestingd data set (in an area in which you are interested) rather than start with a question and then look for data to answer that question. Most questions do not have data available for answering them! But every data set generates interesting questions to answer. 

4) An example source: https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/. Another source: https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html. Pick any data set and outcome variable NOW!

5) Use `nhanes` tibble from **primer.data** to answer this question: What is the difference in pulse rate between two randomly selected female students in this class? 

6) Start a data science project. Repo -> Project -> Quarto. Load up nhanes tibble from the primer.data package. Explore the data, especially pulse and gender.

### Day 14

0) Make sure that you have an outcome variable and a data set: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12K7i51n9IOVlPbZ6gSEp2UUiC5vLZSr86X6hDM3E3CU

1) Before class tomorrow, add a link to the Proof of Fit section demonstrating that you have used your data and your outcome variable to fit a model.

2) You proof-of-fitted-model should look something like: https://rpubs.com/dkane/example

3) Today, we dive into Courage and Temperance, picking up where we left off on Monday.

Class Github:


### Day 15




## Week 6

This week is all about making Demo Day a success.


### Day 1

1) Check out the final projects: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcbtBdRiSOq4ZuEIs032XNxB9O7GndCBSEMWzJlZuhc Add your material, even just your name, if you have not already. We need to know who is presenting.

2) All my/TF comments today will seem more critical than we intend them to be. Sorry! We love your projects and all the hard work you have done. Our comments are meant to be constructive, but they will mostly be things you should change . . .

3) You must invite at least one friend or family member to Demo Day. Be sure to bcc Preceptor (dave.kane@gmail.com ) and your TF, if you like.

Below is a draft email. Modify as you like. We will send this email during class tonight.

---
Please come watch me present my final project for Kane’s Data Science Course at 8:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, July, 12. Links: 

Zoom: https://shorturl.at/gmnB5
Background: bootcamp.davidkane.info/demo_day.html

I don't know whether I will be presenting at 8:00 or 8:30, but I can update you about that on Wednesday.

No worries if you can't make it!
---

2) Goal today is to take a look at everyone's draft project. We will do practice presentations on Tuesday and then public presentations on Wednesday. The definition of successfully completing the course is to present your final project.

4) Make sure to read and follow the Style Guide: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/style-guide.html

5) Make sure you have as many lines of comments as you have lines of code. There is no better way to distinguish between student and professional code than by looking at the comments.

### TF Notes

Goal is to help students have a succesful final project. We do this by both helping them directly but also be highlighting cool stuff in other students' projects. After all, if student A is making interesting use of animation, there is still time for student B to add animation to his final project. 

The culture of data science is one that encourages inspiration from other data scientists!

Make sure to point out errors in following the Style Guide. Tell students to read it!

Tell students to write comments. In fact, spend 10 minutes during your breakout room having all students add comments. And then walk through those comments, giving feedback.

Discuss students' 5 sentence summaries. Focus on the takeaway point. What is the one sentence which they hope viewers will take away from their project?

Review the submissions to the spreadsheet. Several are not following the instructions. Ensure that they do. 


### Day 2

1) Please fill out the final project spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcbtBdRiSOq4ZuEIs032XNxB9O7GndCBSEMWzJlZuhc

If you have already filled it out, please check that your information is correct. Please follow the instructions at the top!

2) Want to thank me or the TFs? Run this code:

Sys.Date() + runif(n = 1, min = 365*5, max = 365*10)

This is a random day sometime in the range of 5 to 10 years from now. Add a note in your calendar for that date to send us a thank you email, letting us know what you are up to, with data science or anything else. Good teachers love to hear from their former students! dave.kane@gmail.com

#### TFs

Make sure that you travel in reverse room numerical order. (I prefer that you move in the opposite order to the students so that you are with different students each time.) That is, if you start in room 3, then you move to room 2 next, and so on.

It is your job to ensure that each presentation is interactive. It is boring for everyone involved if the presenting students just talks and talks. No one is listening! And they know it! Instead, it is up to you to ensure that everyone (and you) ask lots of questions. The presenter should never talk for more than 30 seconds straight.
