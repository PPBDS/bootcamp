# This is a collection of Preceptor's Notes for use before class. 
# Also included are notes to TFs. And notes for me? 
# This is a text document because the contents need to be copy/pasted into Discord.


## Before Next Time

Ensure that tricks used in class are covered in the tutorials and Primer. 

Key items including adding the ec.rds data to primer.data so we can play with that data from the start on week 1. 

Then, making sure the tricks used, like str_replace(county, "*., ", ""), are explained ahead of time. This is really only two tricks, str_replace() function and the regular expression for "everything up to the first comma, and the space which follows it."




## Week 1

### Day 1

#### Preceptor's Notes

Call me "Preceptor."

No four week course does a better job of increasing your odds of getting the future you want.

Video on --- unless there is something going on in your life which prevents it. In which case, discuss with a TF.

Class always begins by looking at the Preceptor's Notes for the day, available here, in Discord.

0) After today, we start on time, often by going to breakout rooms immediately. Let's go now! Introduce yourself to your fellow students. TFs will try and swing by.

1) Links to consider today:

Bootcamp: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/
Schedule: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html
Primer: https://ppbds.github.io/primer/
Final projects: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html

2) Second trip to breakout rooms. Introduce yourselves again but, this time, write down the names of the students in your room and how they found out about the course. I will randomly call on some students to report this info when I bring the class back together.

3) Submit the assignments or you will be removed from the class. Central metaphor of the class is Ulysses and the Sirens. There are several tutorials due on Wednesday before class. Skip any questions which give you trouble.

4) Ask lots of questions on Discord. Other students benefit from both your question and the resulting answers.

5) Answer lots of questions on Discord! Your fellow students (and I) appreciate it. Moreover, you only really understand something once you have taught it.

6) Start the Getting Started tutorial together. Note how your work is automatically saved. Finish in the breakout rooms. One person shares a screen and does not talk. Second person reads the text out loud and tells the first person what to type. Switch roles for each succeeding question.

7) If we have time, let's go back to breakout rooms and start working on first tutorial: Visualization -- Overview. 


#### TF Notes

Make sure, in this class and future ones, that I (or someone else) turn you into a co-host so that you can move from room to room.

Identify a final project or two which you like and which you think are well done. It is OK if one of the projects is yours. Indeed, you should probably clean up your own final project just in case students want to look at it!

I will assign breakout rooms in the order in which you are appear in the staff listing: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/staff.html. You might be responsible for anywhere from 1 to 5 rooms, but they will always be continuous and in staff order. So, if you are the second person listed, and I assigned 3 rooms per TF, then you would get rooms 4, 5 and 6.

You should do more talking/directing today than you will do later. Indeed, you are talking almost all the time when you are in a room today. (This is totally different from later in the session, when you might say very little, allowing students to run the breakout rooms themselves.) Tell a different student to share their screen each time. Tell another student to do the "driving," to tell the first student what to click on. This might seem weird since we are mostly looking at final projects form past years, but we want them to get into practice. So, have the driver say, "Click on the About tab," for example. 

Key goal for today is to help them decide if they should take the course. Please help them! Tell them about the interactive nature of class. Warn them about video always on and cold-calling. Tell them about the tutorials. Show them the final projects.

Make sure your display name in Discord is the name by which students know you, could be just your first name or your whole name. Should not be something opaque. 

For the first class or two, I will make sure that the number of breakout rooms created is a multiple of the number of staff. (This year that number is 4.) You are responsible for the set of rooms in the order in which your photos appear on the same page. So, for example, if there are 20 rooms and 4 staff, I would get rooms 1-5, the second person listed would get rooms 6-10 and so on.

#### Lecture Notes

Go through name/email on tutorial together. Then send them to breakout rooms to do exercises 1 - 5, and then stop there. Talk about final projects. Do 6 with them together. Have about 5 people in each room because there will be more than 1 person who has not done the installation. 


### Day 2

#### Preceptor's Notes

Call me "Preceptor."

0) If possible, please change your Discord and Zoom display name to be your real name. We are a community! Also, please do not pollute the Discord with too much chit-chat with your buddies.

1) Big thanks to all the students (including legend, Ayush Jain, Larry Seltzer, BoatBoy420 among others) using Discord. Much appreciated, especially those answering questions! You are a good person to do so. And, also, you only really understand something once you have explained it to someone else. See, do, teach. 

2) It is always a good idea to reinstall the all.primer.tutorials package before you start a new tutorial. The reason is that we are fixing bugs as they are reported, but you only get those fixes if you reinstall:

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

If you have problems, it is sometimes necessary to remove the package first:

remove.packages("all.primer.tutorials")

3) In the breakout rooms, one person shares a screen and the others tell her what to type. Then, next time, someone else shares.

4) Thanks for all the great comments/questions and bug reports on the tutorials. Much appreciated! We will fix these.

5) Start thinking about the topic for your final project. What are you interested in? Is there data about it?

6) Philosophy page provides background on our pedagogical approach.

7) In the first class, we just worked from the Console. Today, we go "one level up" and work from an R project. Tomorrow, we go one more level up and start with Github.

8) We will be assigning permanent breakout rooms. If there is a student in whose room you would like to be (or a TF you would like to work with), email Miriam at memerheiss@gmail.com before midnight tonight.

9) Never stress about the tutorials! Just do your best. Skip any questions which give you trouble. Ask lots of questions on Discord.

#### TF Notes

Goal for today and tomorrow is to start with nothing and then finish with something published on Rpubs. Today, we start with a new project. Tomorrow, we start with a Github repo. Today's published doc will be messy, because we don't have time to make it look nice. Tomorrow's will be just a clean plot.

If there are specific students you want to work with, let Miriam know.

Going forward, I will not have dedicated rooms assigned. Instead, I will try to visit all the rooms. I expect that we will have 9 rooms total: 1-3 Miriam, 4-6 Felix and 7-9 Alex. We might only have 6 rooms, with two rooms for each of you. Or even just three rooms!

I will move from room to room. Let me know when I arrive if there is anything you want me to discuss. 




### Day 3

1) New experiment with breakout rooms. You will be assigned to the same room for the rest of the course, with the same TF to help you. Hope this works! If you have any complaints, email Miriam. Depending on drops/adds, we may have to adjust these assignments next week. Let's meet your posse!

2) Apologies to the many students who are caught up. This is the last time that we will slow down the class in order to take care of students who have not done the work. Let's go to breakout rooms and ensure that everyone has a free www.github.com account. 

3) R Weekly is a great way to keep up on all the things happening in the world of R: https://rweekly.org/. I subscribe to their weekly email.

4) For picking final projects, ask yourself some questions: What topic are you most interested in? What do you follow on social media? What do you care about even though no one is forcing you to care about it? Tell us, and we can help you find relevant data.

5) Catch up with the tutorials before Monday or you will be removed from class. Note that there are several tutorials due on Monday. You have done the RStudio and Github tutorial, right? If not, pay attention now!

6) Submit your answers for each tutorial assigment separately, one per email. And don't forget that the Subject line of the email should like:

David Kane; RStudio and Github

That is, we want your full name, and the full name of the tutorial, separated by a semi-colon.


7) Goal today is to publish an interesting graphic relating economic connectedness across US counties.





## Week 2


See the daily scripts for more details. Key things this week are getting comfortable with rendering qmd, using Git/Github and then publishing the page to the web.


### Day 4

1) Big thanks to those (including tlonz, Namyuktha, Larry Seltzer and others) pointing our typos and errors in the tutorials, and to those helping out their classmates. Much appreciated.

2) Whenever starting a new tutorial, please:

install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

Do it now! (Never hurts.) And restart R with Command-shift-0. Note that this is zero not the letter O.

3) Time to think hard about your projects. Why has no one asked for help on this #final-project Discord channel?

4) Key goal today is to practice some of the techniques you learned in the Terminal tutorial. You completed that right?

5) See the #class-work channel for the data file which we will be downloading and the plot which I hope to get to. #announcements provides a link for the room assignments.

6) Review assignments for this week.



### Day 5

-1) Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state?

0) Sign up for https://chat.openai.com/ now.

1) Posit Cloud (https://posit.cloud/) is an option for people with computer problems. (Posit is the company behind RStudio.) Following the instructions in Getting Started. 

2) Whenever you, after asking a question on Discord, figure something out, please edit/update your question with the correct answer.

3) Always reinstall the tutorials before starting a new tutorial. It certain weird situations, it may be necessary to explicitly remove and then reinstall:

remove.packages("all.primer.tutorials")
install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

4) Let's learn how to delete a repo. Keep your Github account clean.

5) Let's learn how to fork a repo: 

https://github.com/bootcamp-2023-01/class-2023-02-01-fork

Connect this to a new RStudio project. Data science work often begins with a fork like this. Is there a relationship between the total population in a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in the state?

6) Should we mess around with ChatGPT? https://chat.openai.com/

7) Data Elixir (https://dataelixir.com/) and Data is Plural (https://www.data-is-plural.com/) are great sources for data. (Hat-tip to Ava!)

### Day 6

0) Fork this repo and connect it to a new R project on your computer:

https://github.com/bootcamp-2023-01/class-2023-02-02

1) Is there a relationship between the total population of a state and the average economic connectedness of counties in that state?

2) Have you found data for your final project? Lots of great stuff in the census! It is impossible to do a bad final project when using census data and making a map. Find a variable which interests you! Often, we start with the data rather than with the project idea.

3)  If you have not completed (and submitted) the Quarto Websites Tutorial by Monday, you will not be allowed to attend class.  See the schedule: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html.



## Week 3

Key goal is to show them how to build a final project, from start to finish. First day is just building a Quarto website. This should go fairly fast since they all should have done it in the tutorial already. We do the exact same thing on days 8 and 9, going faster each time and leaving more time for discussion and playing around with the resulting website. 

Whole thing worked very well last time. It is really good to make them comfortable making websites. It is really good to show them how to split out component parts in scripts like download-data.R and make-plots.R.



### Day 7

0) Goal this week is to build a nice looking (mini) final project which uses census data in interesting ways. Today, we just want to get the project up and running.

1) Many thanks to @Zayan for pointing out a key error in the Quarto Websites tutorial. Much appreciated --- as are all the reports about typos, confusions and so on. I have fixed the key error. So, please

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/all.primer.tutorials")

before you start the tutorial. Of course, you should do this before each tutorial.

2) Happy Git and GitHub for the useR is an incredible resource: https://happygitwithr.com/. 

3) Let's make a nice map, following along with Kyle Walker's excellent book:

https://walker-data.com/census-r/mapping-census-data-with-r.html

4) Discuss your ideas for projects. Look at what students have done in prior sessions: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/projects.html

5) Review schedule for this week: https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/schedule.html


### Day 8

0) I decided that the method of starting a new website which we used on Monday (and practiced in the tutorial) is not as clean as it should be. So, I present a better method today. You are, of course, free to use any approach you like. Only change is to check the git bix when creating the project.

1) Thanks for all the suggestions and typo reports (DermotFinn, Justin Yee and others). Much appreciated!

2) There are lots of CRAN packages which specialize in different types of data. Google is your friend! Examples:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/worldfootballR/index.html
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oce/index.html

3) Lots of cool stuff at CRAN Task Views: https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ 


### Day 9

0) You must have a rough draft ready for Monday. Make sure to finish the "Final Project" tutorial. If you don't complete that, don't bother coming to class. 

1) But note that you can always change your project after Monday!

2) Last class, I used the `rds` approach for storing plots. Much better is the `png` approach, as in the tutorial, and as I will demonstrate today.

3) Don't know what to do with your final project? Having trouble finding data? You can always do a Census project as a back-up. But it must be different from the ones we have done in class!

4) Good job with all the questions on Discord! With final project questions, make sure to include your Github and to ensure that all your code/data is pushed. That way, people trying to help you can just fork your repo and then run your code. No one wants to copy/paste your code, much less download your data, from a Discord thread.

5) Ask questions in public Discord. Don't DM me (except for personal issues). Why? I want other people to check out your approach. Maybe there is something for them to learn! I also want them to try to answer questions. That is how you really learn.
