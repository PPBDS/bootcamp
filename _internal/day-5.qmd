## Goal

Learn about forking by forking from my class repo from Monday, perhaps cleaned up. It includes the data and, probably, nothing else. Read in the data and explore it. Make some plots. What do students come up with? In the first week, we told students what sort of plots to make. Not today! 

Distribute a survey, getting background information on students and some opinions.

TFs: More and more the flow of class will be:

  * I tell students to do X and send them to the rooms, mostly without showing them X.
  * I bring them back and cold-call a students to describe what they did.
  * I then (often quickly) show them what they should have done.
  * I tell them to do Y and send them back to the rooms.
  
Your key role is occurs at this point. You might be tempted to help them with Y. After all, I just told them to do Y. They are confused! They need your help! Ignore the urge to help them with Y until you ensure that everyone in the group has X done correctly. That is most important. Leave no student behind! 

Once everyone is caught up with X, let them try to work on Y on their own. If they complete Y before being called back by me, you should challenge them to do more. (You can always remind them to commit and push their work.) 

## Session 1

Start with my repo from last class. Provide a tour.

Show how to delete a repo from the first class last week. We don't keep all the repos we make. Show how, when you go to just https://github.com/ (and are logged in), you get one view of your account. To get a better view, you need your account name, like: https://github.com/davidkane9

Send to breakout rooms to delete repo from Day 1.

## Session 2

Cold call: Did everyone in your group delete the repo?

Go to the repo from Monday. 

https://github.com/Bootcamp-June-2024/class-2024-06-10

Fork it to my personal account.

Connect the forked repo to a new R project on your computer. Send the breakout rooms so that students get started quickly on this work. They should:

Instructions to put in #class-work:

1) Delete one of last week's repos from your Github account.
2) Delete the corresponding project from your computer.
3) Fork and connect, and start loading up the data.

## Session 3

Cold call: Did everyone remember to delete the project from your computer?

Start a Quarto document. Read in the data. Assign to an object `x`.

Render the document. No ugly warnings. I won't show them this, but it is what we are looking for.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: setup
library(tidyverse)

x <- read_csv("data/nyc_tracts.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

## Session 4

Cold call: Walk me through what your group did.

Cold call: Did anyone in your group remember to push to Github? If not, do so now, as a group. Don't forget to edit the .gitignore.

Explore the data

Instructions to put in #class-work:

1) Use some of your favorite explore-the-data commands.
2) Any missing data? 
3) Any patterns in the missing data?

## Session 5

Cold call: What commands did you use to explore the data?

Recall the difference between Console World and QMD World.
