## Choosing an article


## Replicating at least one table



## Replicating at least one regression

## Starting your PDF

Your main article will be in PDF form. It will downloadable from your website, which you have not yet built. The article is built from a QMD file. See examples here: https://github.com/davidkane9/Gov-1006-Papers-Spring-2020

Start by building a PDF with just a title, author, abstract and reference section. (Have AI teach you about references in quarto. You will probably make a .bib file.) The abstract has just one sentence which begins like: "Jones and Smith (2024) argue that . . ." That is, it is just a one sentence summary of what the original article argued. 

Not sure what to write? Ask AI, but only for well-defined sentences/sections. Asking AI to write the whole thing is useless. Asking it to write one sentence which summarizes your replication article is good.


## Writing an abstract

First sentence is a summary of the replication article.

Second sentence highlights what you were able to replicate and what you were not. Again, this is just a summary of your work. You will go into more detail later. There are different sorts of replications. Examples:

    * I was able to replicate all of their results. (You replicated everything.)

    * I was able to replicate their key results. (You replicated some of the tables, but lacked the time/energy to replicate everything.)

    * I could only replicate some of their results. (You found some mistakes, but nothing critical.)

    * I could not replicate some of their key results. (You found major problems.)

Third and fourth sentences.
