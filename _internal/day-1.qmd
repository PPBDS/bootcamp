## Goal

Explore the connectedness data from the primer.data. Answer some questions. 

Students will have completed the Introduction tutorial, so they have been exposed to both ggplot2 and to the pipe.

## Session 1

Go to the Preceptor's Notes. Talk through the first few items.

Give a quick tour of RStudio. (Make sure that you are starting your session in an empty project and with no code visible.) Show the three *panes*: Console, Environment and Output. Mention the different *tabs*. 

Type 2 + 2. 

Tell them to update the key packages:

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/tutorial.helpers")
```

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")
```


Send them to breakout rooms to do the same.



## Session 2

Pull up chatGPT. Require them to sign up for one of the services. Encourage them to pay for one of them. Mention that I use Claude. Show the tab for Claude.



## Session 3

* Show them library(tidyverse). Discuss those weird messages. Explain the concept of the Tidyverse. Mention that we load up this package (i.e., this collection of packages) whenever we R.

* Show them library(primer.data). 

* Type connectedness. Run ?connectedness. 

What is the third biggest, by population, county in the US?
