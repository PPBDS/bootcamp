## Goal

Explore the connectedness data from the primer.data. Answer some questions. 

Students will have completed the Introduction tutorial, so they have been exposed to both ggplot2 and to the pipe.

## Session 1

Go to the Preceptor's Notes. Talk through the first few items. Finish with room assignments. Send them to those rooms.

## Session 2

Review breakout room behavior. One person always sharing, and then doing nothing but what they are told. Another person driving, telling the screen-sharer what to do.

Go through items 2 (useful links) and 3 (install tutorial.helpers). 

Give a quick tour of RStudio. (Make sure that you are starting your session in an empty project and with no code visible.) Show the three *panes*: Console, Environment and Output. Mention the different *tabs*. 

Type 2 + 2. 

Tell them to update tutorial.helpers

```
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/tutorial.helpers")
```

Send them to breakout rooms to do the same.

But do this together! One person shares their screen. One other person drives.

## Session 3

Review items 4 (Ulysses), 5 (Discord) and 6 (chatGPT).

Pull up chatGPT. Require them to sign up for one of the services. No need to pay! Free service is fine. Mention that I use Claude. Show the tab for Claude.

Send them to breakout rooms to do the same. Tell them to help (by having them share their screen) whomever is having the most problems.

## Session 4

* Show them library(tidyverse). Discuss those weird messages. Explain the concept of the Tidyverse. Mention that we load up this package (i.e., this collection of packages) whenever we use R.

* Show them library(primer.data). 

* Type connectedness. Run ?connectedness. 

* See Preceptor Notes for links.

* Explain the need to reinstall r4ds.tutorials each week-end. We are always fixing bugs!

remotes::install_github("PPBDS/r4ds.tutorials")

Go to breakout rooms. Reinstall r4ds.tutorials. Switch the screen-sharer and driver. Then, answer this question:

What is the third biggest, by population, county in the US?

## Session 5

Call on someone at random to tell me what to code.
