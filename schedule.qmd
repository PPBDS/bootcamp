*ROUGHT DRAFT*: Course is being modified from 4 week to 6 weeks.

Classes run from 8:00 to 9:00 PM EDT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane and their [associated]() [tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/all.primer.tutorials/). Assignments associated with a specific lecture must be completed before that lecture.

Completed tutorials are sent to kanes.datacamp@gmail.com with your name and the name of the tutorial separated by a semi-colon  --- like "Sarah Jones; Getting Started" --- in the subject line. If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format.

# Week 1: Visualization

Looking at the data is the first step in data science.

## Monday 

* Read [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/00-getting-started.html) and follow all the associated instructions. We will do the Getting Started tutorial from the **tutorial.helpers** package together in class.

## Wednesday 

<!-- DK: Maybe this is a bit too much work for the first week? -->

* Read Chapters 1 through 4 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the **r4ds.tutorials** package, complete the associated tutorials: Data Visualization, RStudio and Code, and Data Transformation.

* Optional: [Get Started with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2023-05-15-get-started/) video.

## Thursday 

* Read Chapters 5, 6 and 8 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the **r4ds.tutorials** package, complete the associated tutorials: RStudio and Github, Data Tidying, RStudio and Code, and Data Transformation tutorials.

Reminder: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

# Week 2: Wrangling

Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up messy data. To help generate ideas for the final projects, we will also take a close look at US census data.

## Monday 

* Read Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the **r4ds.tutorials** package, complete the Terminal tutorial. Also complete the tutorials associated with the readings: Getting Help, Layers, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Communication. Note that the Terminal tutorial is at the end of the collection. 
 

## Wednesday 

* Read chapters 13, 14, 15 and 16 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the **r4ds.tutorials** package, complete the associated tutorials: Logical, Numbers, Strings, and Regular Expressions. 

## Thursday

* Read chapters 17 and 18 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the **r4ds.tutorials** package, complete the associated tutorials: Factors and Dates and Times. 



# Week 3: Data

Now that we know how to clean and organize messy data, we need to learn how to get some data.

## Monday 

* Complete Quarto Websites tutorial.

* Complete Getting Help tutorial.


## Wednesday 

* Read the [Style Guide](https://rpubs.com/dkane/style-guide).

## Thursday 

* Complete Data - Webscraping tutorial.

# Week 4: Models

## Monday

<!-- DK: Should we do the other chapter tutorials as well. Maybe? -->

* Read [Chapter 4 Rubin Causal Model](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/04-rubin-causal-model.html). Focus on sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.4. 

* From the **all.primer.tutorials** package, complete Rubin Causal Model - Overview tutorial.

## Wednesday

* Read [Chapter 5 Probability](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/05-probability.html). Focus on sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.7, and 5.8. 

* From the **all.primer.tutorials** package, complete Probability - Overview tutorial.

## Thursday


# Week 5: Inference

## Monday

* Read [Chapter 6 One Parameter](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/06-one-parameter.html). Focus on sections 6.3 and 6.4. 

* From the **all.primer.tutorials** package, complete One Parameter - Overview tutorial.

## Wednesday

# Week 6: Projects

The last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers.


## Monday 

* Complete Final Project tutorial before class, or you will be removed the course. There are no extensions for this assignment.

* You must have a draft of your final project ready to go, including a Quarto website and your four sentence introduction. 


## Wednesday 

* Practice presentations and feedback. You must have your presentation ready to go! 

## Thursday
