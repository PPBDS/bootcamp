<!-- Maybe move some of the R4DS tutorials into weeks 3 and 4? Week 1 workload is OK. Seems like week 2 has a lot of work . . . if we write the tutorials! -->

Classes run from 8:00 to 9:00 PM EDT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane and their [associated](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) [tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/all.primer.tutorials/). Homework should be completed before the class meeting for which it is assigned. We also reference [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker.

See the home pages for the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**all.primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/all.primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

Completed tutorials are sent to **kanes.datacamp@gmail.com** with your name and the name of the tutorial separated by a semi-colon  --- like "Sarah Jones; Getting Started" --- in the subject line. If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format.

# Week 1: Visualization

Looking at the data is the first step in data science.

## Monday 

* Read [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/00-getting-started.html) and follow all the associated instructions. We will do the Getting Started tutorial from the [**tutorial.helpers**](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/) package together in class.

## Wednesday 

* Read Chapters 1 through 4 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the associated tutorials: RStudio and Github, Data Tidying and Data Import tutorials.

**Reminder**: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

# Week 2: Wrangling

Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up messy data. 

## Monday 

* Read Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the Terminal tutorial. Also complete the tutorials associated with the readings: Getting Help, Layers, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Communication. Note that the Terminal tutorial is at the end of the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) collection. 
 

## Wednesday 

* Read chapters 13, 14, 15 and 16 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the associated tutorials: Logical, Numbers, Strings, and Regular Expressions. 

## Thursday

* Read chapters 17, 18, 19 and 29 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the associated tutorials: Factors, Dates and times, Missing values, and Joins. 


# Week 3: Data

Now that we know how to clean and organize messy data, we need to learn how to get some data.

The last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth. Your final project will be, for most of you, the first item in your professional portfolio, something so impressive that you will be eager to show it to graduate schools or potential employers.
