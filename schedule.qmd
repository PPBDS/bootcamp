**Submit each of your homework answers, as an html file, via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/j3hBXL1XT3JMiscN8) before midnight on the day before the class for which the homework was assigned.**


Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane, [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker. 

See the home pages for [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/), [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

Always reinstall the relevant package before starting a new tutorial. Example for **primer.tutorials**:

```
remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

We are always fixing mistakes. You want to use the latest version.

If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `positron_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `positron_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.


# Week 1: June 16

Introduction to the tools we use for doing data science.

## Monday 

**Monday's homework must be completed before midnight on Sunday**. I ensure this by only sending the Zoom link for class to students who submitted the homework.

* Read the Introduction from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Introduction" (`00-introduction`) tutorial. 

* From the [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/) package, complete the "Positron and Code" (`01-code`) tutorial. Make sure that you have already completed the "Introduction" tutorial above before you start the "Positron and Code" tutorial.

## Wednesday

* From the [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/) package, complete the "Positron and Quarto" (`02-quarto`) and "Terminal" (`03-terminal`) tutorials.

**Reminder**: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

## Thursday 

Going forward, we recommend that you read the chapters in [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) associated with each tutorial we assign from the **r4ds.tutorials** package. However, we stop listing them explicitly.

* From the [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/) package, complete the "Positron and GitHub Introduction" (`04-github-1`) tutorial.

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Data tidying" (`05-data-tidying`).
