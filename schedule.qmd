<!-- Maybe move some of the R4DS tutorials into weeks 3 and 4? Week 1 workload is OK. Seems like week 2 has a lot of work . . . if we write the tutorials! -->

Classes run from 8:00 to 9:00 PM EDT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane, and their [associated](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) [tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/). Homework should be completed before the class meeting for which it is assigned. We also reference [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker.

See the home pages for the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

**Always reinstall the relevant package before starting a new tutorial.** We are always fixing mistakes. You want to use the latest version.

Completed tutorials are submitted via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/fCZm77KPW4923Xk27). If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `getting-started_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `getting-started_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.

# Week 1: Data

Looking at the data is the first step in data science.

## Monday 

* Before class, please read [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html) and follow all the associated instructions. Complete the "Getting Started" tutorial from the [**tutorial.helpers**](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/) package. Submit your answers, as an html file, via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/fCZm77KPW4923Xk27).

## Wednesday 

* Read the Introduction and Chapters 1 and 2 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete three tutorials: Introduction, Data Visualization and RStudio and Code. The third of these is the most important. Submit your answers via the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/fCZm77KPW4923Xk27). (Note that you need to submit each set of answers separately.)

## Thursday 

* Read Chapters 3, 4, and 5 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the associated tutorials: Data Transformation, RStudio and Github, and Data Tidying tutorials. The most important of these is RStudio and Github.

**Reminder**: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

# Week 2: Models

Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up messy data. 

## Monday

The last week will consist of projects that the students will make. Do you love soccer or wine or NYC politics? The final project provides you with an opportunity to study that topic in depth.
