Classes run from 8:00 to 9:00 PM EDT on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane, [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker, along with their [their](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) [associated](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/) [tutorials](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/). Homework should be completed before the class meeting for which it is assigned.

See the home pages for the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

**Always reinstall the relevant package before starting a new tutorial.** We are always fixing mistakes. You want to use the latest version.

Completed tutorials are submitted via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/ScrSYjb6pYPbtvNj7). If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `getting-started_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `getting-started_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.


# Registration

To register for the class and reserve your spot, please read [Getting Started](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/getting-started.html) and follow all the associated instructions. Complete the "Getting Started with Tutorials" tutorial from the [**tutorial.helpers**](https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/) package. Submit your answers, as an html file, via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/ScrSYjb6pYPbtvNj7).

# Week 1: Data: June 3

Looking at the data is the first step in data science. Note that Monday's homework must be completed before Monday's class. I ensure this by only sending the Zoom link for class to students who submitted the homework.

## Monday 

* Read the Introduction from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the "Introduction" tutorial. Submit your answers via the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/ScrSYjb6pYPbtvNj7). 

## Wednesday 

* Read Chapters 1 and 2 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete two tutorials: "Data Visualization" and "RStudio and Code." The second of these is the most important. Submit your answers via the usual [Google form](https://forms.gle/ScrSYjb6pYPbtvNj7). 

## Thursday 

* Read Chapters 3 and 4 from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). 

* From the [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/) package, complete the associated tutorials: "Data Transformation" and "RStudio and Github." The most important of these is "RStudio and Github."

**Reminder**: All work must be completed before class. Failure to submit your tutorial answers will result in you being removed from the course. It is not fair to your fellow students, with whom you will be working in small groups, for you to not be prepared for class.

# Week 2: Models: June 10

Now that we know how to visualize data that is already clean, we need to learn how to clean up messy data.
