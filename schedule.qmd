**THIS IS AN INCOMPLETE DRAFT SCHEDULE**

**Submit your homework answers, as an html file, via [this Google form](https://forms.gle/j3hBXL1XT3JMiscN8) before midnight on the day before the class for which the homework was assigned.**


Key resources: [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund, [*Preceptor's Primer for Bayesian Data Science*](https://ppbds.github.io/primer/) by David Kane, [*Analyzing US Census Data: Methods, Maps, and Models in R*](https://walker-data.com/census-r/) by Kyle Walker. 

See the home pages for [**positron.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/positron.tutorials/), [**r4ds.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/r4ds.tutorials/), [**primer.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/primer.tutorials/), and [**tidycensus.tutorials**](https://ppbds.github.io/tidycensus.tutorials/) for installation instructions.

Always reinstall the relevant package before starting a new tutorial. Example for **primer.tutorials**:

```
remove.packages("primer.tutorials")
remotes::install_github("PPBDS/primer.tutorials")
```

We are always fixing mistakes. You want to use the latest version.


If you do not complete the tutorials on time, you will be removed from the class. Send in your tutorial answers saved in *html* format. Please try to ensure that the name of the file is the default name, like `tutorials-in-positron_answers.html`. Avoid using the name which will be assigned to the file if you download the same answers twice (or more), stuff like `tutorials-in-positron_answers (2).html`. You can just change the name of the file by hand if this happens.


# Registration

Do not start the registration process yet.

# Week 1: June 16

Looking at the data is the first step in data science. Note that Monday's homework must be completed before Monday's class. I ensure this by only sending the Zoom link for class to students who submitted the homework.

## Monday 

* Read the Introduction from [*R for Data Science (2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).
