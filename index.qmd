**Kane's (Free) Data Science Course** is offered occasionally, running for 6 weeks. The next session will probably be in June. The workload is 10 hours per week: 3 hours in class with [former Harvard Preceptor David Kane](https://www.davidkane.info/), lecturing live on Zoom at around 8:00 PM EDT and 7 hours of work completed by students on their own. By the end of this course, students will be able to do basic data science! **There is no charge.**

There are no prerequisites. The programming language we will be using is R. You must have a computer with R, RStudio and Git [installed](https://happygitwithr.com). You must be able to use Zoom and to share your screen. The course is designed for absolute beginners. Neither programming nor statistics experience is required.
